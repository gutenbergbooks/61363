<h2>Preface</h2>
<p><em>The Universal Kinship</em> means the kinship of all the
inhabitants of the planet Earth. Whether they came into existence
among the waters or among desert sands, in a hole in the earth, in
the hollow of a tree, or in a palace; whether they build nests or
empires; whether they swim, fly, crawl, or ambulate; and whether
they realise it or not, they are all related, physically, mentally,
morally—this is the thesis of this book. But since man is the most
gifted and influential of animals, and since his relationship with
other animals is more important and more reluctantly recognised
than any other, the chief purpose of these pages is to prove and
interpret the kinship, of the human species with the other species
of animals.</p>
<p>The thesis of this book comes pretty squarely in conflict with
widely-practised and highly-prized sins. It will therefore be
generally criticised where it is not passed by in silence. Men as a
rule do not care to improve. Although they have but one life to
live, they are satisfied to live the thing out as they have started
on it.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm, which in an enlightened or ideal race would be
devoted to self-improvement, is used by men in weaving excuses for
their own inertia or in singing of the infirmities of others.</p>
<p><em>But there is a Future</em>. And the creeds and ideals, men
bow down to to-day will in time to come pass away, and new creeds
and ideals will claim their allegiance. Shrines change as the
generations come and go, and out of the decomposition of the old
comes the new. The time will come when the sentiments of these
pages will not be hailed by two or three, and ridiculed or ignored
by the rest; <em>they will represent Public Opinion and
Law</em>.</p>

<blockquote class="margin-vertical">
<p>‘Like the Roman emperors, who, intoxicated by their power, at
length regarded themselves as demigods, so the ruler of the earth
believes that the animals subjected to his will have nothing in
common with his own nature. Man is not content to be the king of
animals. He insists on having it that an impassable gulf separates
him from his subjects. The affinity of the ape disturbs and humbles
him. And, turning his back upon the earth, he flies, with his
threatened majesty, into the cloudy sphere of a special “human
kingdom.” But Anatomy, like those slaves who followed the
conqueror’s car crying, “Thou art a man,” disturbs him in his
self-admiration, and reminds him of those plain and tangible
realities which unite him with the animal world.’</p>
<p class="small-caps center no-padding-no-margin">— Broca.</p>

<h2>The Universal Kinship</h2>
<h2>The Physical Kinship</h2>
<h3 id="part1-chapter1">I. Man an Animal.</h3>
<p>It was in the zoology class at college. We had made all the long
journey from amoeba to coral, from coral to worm, from worm to
mollusk, from mollusk to fish, from fish to reptile, and from
reptile to mammal—and there, in the closing pages of faithful old
Packard, we found it. ‘A mammal of the order of primates,’ the book
said, with that unconcern characteristic of the deliverances of
science. I was almost saddened. It was the first intimation I had
ever received of that trite but neglected truth that <em>man is an
animal</em>.</p>
<p>But the intimation was so weak, and I was at that time so
unconscious, that it was not till years later that I began, through
reflection, actually to realise the truth here first caught sight
of. During these years I knew that man was not a mineral nor a
plant—that, indeed, he belonged to the animal kingdom. But, like
most men still, I continued to think of him as being altogether
different from other animals. I thought of man <em>and the
animals</em>, <em>not</em> of man and the <em>other</em> animals.
Man was somehow <em>sui generis</em>. He had had, I believed, a
unique and miraculous origin; for I had not yet learned of organic
evolution. The pre-Darwinian belief that I had come down from the
skies, and that non-human creatures of all kinds had been brought
into existence as adjuncts of the distinguished species to which I
belonged, occupied prominent place in my thinking. Non-human races,
so I had been taught, had in themselves no reason for existence.
They were accessories. A chasm, too wide for any bridge ever to
span, yawned between the human and all other species. Man was
celestial, a blue-blood barely escaping divinity. All other beings
were little higher than clods. So faithfully and mechanically did I
reflect the bias in which I had grown up. </p>
<p>But man <em>is</em> an <em>animal</em>. It was away out there on
the prairies, among the green corn rows, one beautiful June
morning—a long time ago it seems to me now—that this revelation
really came to me. And I repeat it here, as it has grown to seem to
me, for the sake of a world which is so wise in many things, but so
darkened and wayward regarding this one thing. However averse to
accepting it we may be on account of favourite traditions, man is
an animal in the most literal and materialistic meaning of the
word. Man has not a spark of so-called ‘divinity’ about him. In
important respects he is the most highly evolved of animals; but in
origin, disposition, and form he is no more ‘divine’ than the dog
who laps his sores, the terrapin who waddles over the earth in a
carapace, or the unfastidious worm who dines on the dust of his
feet. Man is not the pedestalled individual pictured by his
imagination—a being glittering with prerogatives, and towering
apart from and above all other beings. He is a pain-shunning,
pleasure-seeking, death-dreading organism, differing in
particulars, but not in kind, from the pain-shunning,
pleasure-seeking, death-dreading organisms below and around him.
Man is neither a rock, a vegetable, nor a deity. He belongs to the
same class of existences, and has been brought into existence by
the same evolutional processes, as the horse, the toad that hops in
his garden, the firefly that lights its twilight torch, and the
bivalve that reluctantly feeds him.</p>
<p>Man’s body is composed fundamentally of the same materials as
the bodies of all other animals. The bodies of all animals are
composed of clay. They are formed of the same elements as those
that murmur in the waters, gallop in the winds, and constitute the
substance of the insensate rocks and soils. More than two-thirds of
the weight of the human body is made up of oxygen alone, a gas
which forms one-fifth of the weight of the air, more than
eight-ninths of that of the sea, and forty-seven per cent, of the
superficial solids of the earth.</p>
<p>Man’s body is composed of cells. So are the bodies of all other
animals. And the cells in the body of a human being are not
essentially different in composition or structure from the cells in
the body of the sponge. All cells are composed primarily of
protoplasm, a compound of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
Like all other animals, man is incapable of producing a particle of
the essential substance of which his body is made. No animal can
produce protoplasm. This is a power of the plant, and the plant
only. All that any animal can do is to burn the compounds formed in
the sun-lit laboratories of the vegetable world. The human
skeleton, like the skeletons of nearly all other animals, is
composed chiefly of lime—lime being, in the sea, where life spent
so many of its earlier centuries, the most available material for
parts whose purpose it is to furnish shape and durability to the
organism. Man grows from an egg. So do all creatures of clay. Every
animal commences at the same place—in a single, lowly, almost
homogeneous cell. A dog, a frog, a philosopher, and a worm cannot
for a long time after their embryonic commencement be distinguished
from each other. Like the oyster, the ox, the insect, and the fish,
like all that live, move, and breathe, man is mortal. He increases
in size and complexity through an allotted period of time; then,
like all his kindred, wilts back into the indistinguishable flux
from which he came. Man inhales oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide.
So does every animal that breathes, whether it breathe by lungs,
gills, skin, or ectosarc, and whether it breathe the sunless ooze
of the sea floor or the ethereal blue of the sky. Animals inhale
oxygen because they eat carbon and hydrogen. The energy of all
animals is produced mainly by the union of oxygen with the elements
of carbon and hydrogen in the tissues of animal bodies, the
plentiful and ardent oxygen being the most available supporter of
the combustion of these two elements.</p>
<p>Man is, then, an animal, more highly evolved than the most of
his fellow-beings, but positively of the same clay, and of the same
fundamental make-up, with the same eagerness to exceed and the same
destiny, as his less pompous kindred who float and frolic and pass
away in the seas and atmospheres, and creep over the land-patches
of a common clod.</p>
<h3 id="part1-chapter2">II. Man a Vertebrate.</h3>
<p>Man is a <em>vertebrate</em> animal.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter2-footnote1" id="part1-chapter2-ref1" name=
"part1-chapter2-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup> He has (anatomically at
least) a backbone. He belongs to that substantial class of
organisms possessing an articulating internal skeleton—the family
of the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Most
animals have some sort of skeleton, some sort of calcareous
contrivance, whose business it is to give form and protection to
the softer parts of the organism. Some animals, as the starfishes,
have plates of lime scattered throughout the surface parts of the
body; others, as the corals and sponges secrete plant-like frames,
upon and among the branches of which the organisms reside; and
still others, as the clams, crustaceans, and insects, have
skeletons consisting of a shell or sheath on the outside of, and
more or less surrounding, the softer substances of the body. The
limbs of insects are tiny tubes on the inside of which are the
miniature muscles with which they perform their marvels of
locomotion. The skeleton of vertebrates, consisting of levers,
beams, columns, and arches, all skilfully joined together and sunk
deep within the muscular tissue, forms a conspicuous contrast to
the rudimentary frames of other animals. The vertebrate skeleton
consists of a hollow axis, divided into segments and extending
along the dorsal region of the body, from the ventral side of which
articulate, by means of awkwardly-constructed girdles, an anterior
and a posterior pair of limbs. This dorsal axis ends in front in a
peculiar bulbous arrangement called the head, which contains, among
other valuables, the brain and buccal cavern. The thoracic segments
of the backbone send off pairs of flat bones, which, arching
ventrally, form the chest for the protection of the heart and other
vitals. The limbs (except in fishes) consist each of a single long
bone, succeeded by two long bones, followed by two transverse rows
of short, irregular wrist or ankle bones, ending normally in five
branching series of bones called digits. This is essentially the
skeleton of all fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
In short, it is the universal vertebrate type of frame. There are
minor modifications to suit the various kinds of environment,
adaptations to the necessities of aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial
locomotion and life, some parts being specialised, others
atrophied, and still others omitted, but there is never anywhere,
from fishes to philosophers, any fundamental departure from the
established vertebrate type of skeleton.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter2-footnote2" id="part1-chapter2-ref2" name=
"part1-chapter2-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup> The pectoral fins of
fishes correspond to the fore-limbs of frogs and reptiles, the
wings of birds, and the arms of men. The pelvic fins of fishes are
homologous with the hind-limbs of frogs, reptiles, and quadrupeds,
and the legs of birds, apes, and men. The foot of the dog and
crocodile, the hand of the orang, and the flipper of the dolphin
and seal, all have the same general structure as the hand of man;
and the wings of the bat and bird, the forelimbs of the lizard and
elephant, and the comical shovels of the mole and ornithorhynchus,
notwithstanding the great differences in their external appearance
and use, contain essentially the same bones and the same
arrangement of the bones as do the arms of men and women. The human
body has two primary cavities in it. So have the bodies of all
vertebrates: a neural cavity containing the brain and spinal cord,
and a visceral cavity containing the heart, liver, lungs, and
alimentary canal. Invertebrates have only one body cavity—the one
corresponding to the visceral cavity of vertebrates—and the main
nerve trunk, instead of extending along the back, as among
vertebrates, is in invertebrates located ventrally. Vertebrates are
the only animals on the earth that have a highly developed
circulatory system, a system entirely shut off from the other
systems, and containing a heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries.
In all invertebrates the digestive and circulatory systems remain
to a greater or less extent connected, the blood and food mingling
more or less in the general cavity of the body. Worms and insects
have pulsating tubes instead of heart and arteries. Crustaceans
have hearts with one chamber, and mollusks have two or three
chambered hearts, but the blood, instead of returning to the heart
after its journey through the arteries, passes into the body
cavity. In man and other vertebrates the circulating current is
confined strictly to the bloodvessels, no particle of it ever
escaping into the general body cavity. The heart of vertebrates is
distinguished from that of invertebrates by being located
ventrally. The heart of invertebrates is in the back. The blood of
vertebrates differs from that of invertebrates in containing both
red and white corpuscles. Invertebrates have white corpuscles only.
Worms have yellow, red, or bright green blood. The blood of
crustaceans is bluish, that of mollusks is white, and that of
insects dusky or brown. The blood of all vertebrates, excepting
amphioxus, is red. All backboned beings, whether they dwell in seas
or cities, and whether they build nests or empires, have two eyes,
two ears, nose and mouth, all located in the head, and always
occupying the same relative position to each other. Invertebrates
may have their brains in their abdomen, as do the mites; hear with
their legs or antennae, as many insects do; see with their tunics,
like the scallops; and breathe with their skin, as do the worms.
The crayfish hears with its ‘feelers,’ the cricket and katydid with
their fore-legs, the grasshopper with its abdomen, the clam with
its ‘foot,’ and mysis and other low crustaceans have their auditory
organs on their tails.  </p>
<p>Man is, then, like the fishes, frogs, reptiles, birds, and
quadrupeds, a vertebrate animal. Excepting in his infancy, when he
is a quadruped going on all fours, he uses his posterior limbs only
for locomotion, and his anterior for prehension and the like. His
spinal axis is erect instead of horizontal, and his tail is
atrophied. But he possesses all of the unmistakable qualities of
the vertebrate type of structure—a two-chambered body cavity, a
highly developed and dorsally located nerve trunk, vertebrate
vitals, a closed circulatory system, a ventral heart, red blood, a
head containing sense organs and brain, and a well-ordered internal
skeleton, consisting of a vertebral column with skull and ribs and
two pairs of limbs, the limbs consisting each of one long bone, two
long bones, two transverse rows of irregular bones, and five
branches at the end.</p>

<img src="./images/classes-of-animals.jpg" alt=
"Classes of Animals" />
<h3 id="part1-chapter3">III. Man a Mammal.</h3>
<p>Man is a <em>mammal</em>. He belongs to the most brilliant and
influential of the five classes of vertebrates—the class to which
belong so many of his associates and victims, the class to which
belong the horse, the dog, the deer, the ox, the sheep, the swine,
the squirrel, the camel, the unattenuated elephant, and the
timid-hearted hare. To this class belong also the lion, the tiger,
the kangaroo, the beaver, the bear, the bat, the monkey, the mole,
the wolf, the ornithorhynchus, and the whale—in short, <em>all
animals that have hair</em>. Fishes and reptiles have scales; birds
have feathers; all mammals are covered to a greater or less extent
with hair. The aquatic habits of whales render hair of no use to
them. Hence, while the unborn of these animals still cling to the
structural traditions of their ancestors and are covered with hair,
the adults are almost hairless. The sartorial habits of human
beings and the selective influences of the sexes have had a similar
effect on the hairy covering of the human body. Hair exists all
over the human body surface, excepting on the soles of the hands
and feet, but in a greatly dwarfed condition. It is only on the
scalp and on the faces of males, where it is scientifically
assisted for purposes of display, that it grows luxuriantly. It is
by no means certain that even the hair on the masculine scalp will
last forever. For if the hermetical derby and other deadly devices
worn by men continue their devastations as they have in the past,
we may expect to have, in the course of generations, men with
foreheads reaching regularly to the occiput. Most animals lay eggs.
Man does not. Like the dog, the horse, the squirrel, and the bat,
man is viviparous, the eggs hatching within the parental body.
Human young are born helpless, and are sustained during the period
of their infancy by the secretions of the milk glands. So are all
the sons and daughters of mammals. Whether they come into the world
among the waters or among the desert sands, in the hollow of a
tree, in a hole in the earth, or in a palace, the children of
mammals are frail and pitiful, and they survive to grow and
multiply only because they are the object of the loving and
incessant sacrifices of a mother. </p>
<p>Mammals are distinguished from all other animals by the
possession of two kinds of skin glands—the sweat glands and the oil
glands—and by the development of certain of these glands in the
female into organs for the nourishing of the young. Among reptiles
and birds the lower jaw is suspended from the skull by a bone
called the quadrate bone. Among men and other mammals the lower jaw
is joined directly to the skull, the quadrate bone becoming, in the
vicissitudes of evolution, the hammer (malleus) of the mammalian
ear. Man has a four-chambered heart—two reservoirs which receive,
and two pumps which propel, the scarlet waters of the body. Fishes
have two-chambered hearts; frogs and most reptiles have
three-chambered hearts; all mammals and birds have four-chambered
hearts. The red corpuscles in the blood of fishes, frogs, reptiles,
and birds, are discs, double-convex, nucleated, and in shape oval
or triangular. In man and in all other mammals (except the archaic
camel) the red corpuscles are double-concave, non-nucleated, and
circular. ‘Man has a diaphragm dividing the body cavity into chest
and abdomen, and a shining white bridge of interlacing fibres,
called <em>corpus callosum</em>, uniting his cerebral hemispheres.
And man is a mammal because, like other mammals, he has, in
addition to the qualities already mentioned, these valuable and
distinct characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="part1-chapter4">IV. Man a Primate.</h3>
<p>Man is a <em>primate</em>. There are four divisions in the order
of primates—lemurs, monkeys, apes, and men. But the most
interesting and important of these, according to man, is man. Man
is a primate because, like other primates, he has arms and hands
instead of fore-legs. And these are important characteristics. It
was a splendid moment when the tendencies of evolution, pondering
the possibilities of structural improvement, decided to rear the
vertebrate upon its hind-limbs, and convert its anterior appendages
into instruments of manipulation. So long as living creatures were
able simply to move through the airs and waters of the earth and
over the surface of the solids, they were powerless to modify the
universe about them very much. But the moment beings were developed
with parts of their bodies fitted to take hold of and move and
fashion and compel the universe around them, that moment the life
process was endowed with the power of miracles. With the invention
of hands and arms commenced seriously that long campaign against
the tendencies of inanimate nature which finds its most marvellous
achievements in the sustained and triumphant operations of human
industry. None of the primates excepting man use their hind-limbs
as a sole means of changing their place in the universe, but in all
of them the fore-limbs are regularly used as organs of
manipulation. Man is a primate because his fingers and toes, like
those of other primates (except the tiny marmosets of Brazil), end
in nails. Man has neither claws to burrow into the earth, talons
with which to hold and rend his victims, nor hoofs to put thunder
into his movements. The human stomach, like that of all the other
primates, is a bagpipe. The stomach of the carnivora is usually a
simple sack, while rodents have, as a rule, two stomachs, and
ruminants four. Man is a primate because his milk glands are
located on the breast and are two in number. The mammary glands
vary in number in the different orders of mammals, from two in the
horse and whale to twenty-two in some insectivora. Most ruminating
animals have four, swine ten, and carnivora generally six or eight.
These glands may be located in the region of the groin, as in the
horse and whale; between the forelimbs, as in the elephant and bat;
or arranged in pairs extending from the fore to the hind limbs, as
in the carnivora and swine. In man and all other primates (except
lemurs) the mammary glands are pectoral and two in number. All
primates, including man, have also a disc-shaped placenta. The
placenta is the organ of nutrition in mammalian embryos. It is
found in all young-bearing animals above the marsupials, and
consists of a mass of glands between the embryo and the parental
body. In some animals it entirely surrounds and encloses the
embryo; in others it assumes the form of a girdle; and in still
others it is bell-shaped. The primates are the only animals in
which this peculiar organ is in the shape of a simple
disc.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter4-footnote1" id=

<p>The nearest relatives by blood man has in this world are the
exceedingly man-like apes—the tailless anthropoids—the gorillas and
chimpanzees of Africa, and the orangs and gibbons of southern and
insular Asia. The fact that man is an actual relative and
descendant of the ape is one of the most disagreeable of the many
distasteful truths which the human mind in its evolution has come
upon. To a vanity puffed, as is that of human beings, to the
splitting, the consanguinity of gorilla and gentleman seems
horrible. Man prefers to have arrived on the earth by way of a
ladder let down by his imagination from the celestial concave.
Within his own memory man has been guilty of many foolish and
disgraceful things. But this attempt by him to repudiate his
ancestors by surreptitiously fabricating for himself an origin
different from, and more glorious than the rest is one of the most
absurd and scandalous in the whole list. It is a shallow logic—the
logic of those who, without worth of their own, try to shine with a
false and stolen lustre. No more masterly rebuke was ever
administered to those in the habit of sneering at the truth in this
matter than the caustic reply of Huxley to the taunt of the
fat-witted Bishop—that he would rather be the descendant of a
respectable ape than the descendant of one who not only closed his
eyes to the facts around him, but used his official position to
persuade others to do likewise. Man’s reluctance to take his
anatomical place beside his simian kinspeople has been exceeded
only by his selfish and high-handed determination to exclude all
other terrestrial beings from his heaven. </p>
<p>Man is a talkative and religious ape. He is an ape, but with a
much greater amount of enterprise and with a greater likelihood of
being found in every variety of climate. Like the anthropoid, man
has a bald face and an obsolete tail. But he is distinguished from
his arboreal relative by his arrogant bearing, his skilled larynx,
and especially by the satisfaction he experiences in the
contemplation of the image which appears when he looks in a
mirror.</p>
<p>The man-like apes are from three to six feet tall, and are all
of them very strong, the gorilla, who sometimes weighs over three
hundred pounds, being about the bravest and most formidable unarmed
animal on the planet. They are erect or semi-erect, have loud
voices, plantigrade feet, and irritable dispositions—in all of
these particulars being strikingly like men. The gorilla,
chimpanzee, and gibbon are highlanders, preferring the uplands and
mountains. The orang is a lowlander, living phlegmatically among
the sylvan swamps of Sumatra and Borneo. The gorilla and chimpanzee
are terrestrial, seldom going among the trees except to get food or
to sleep. The orang and gibbon are arboreal, seldom coming to the
ground except to drink or bathe. They all walk on their hind-limbs,
generally in a stooping posture, with their knuckles or fingers
touching the ground. But they sometimes walk with their arms
hanging down by their sides, and sometimes with their hands clasped
back of their heads to give them balance. None of them ever place
their palms on the ground when they walk—that is, none of them walk
on four feet. The anthropoid races, in the shape of their heads and
faces and in the general form and structure of their bodies, and
even in their habits of life, resemble in a remarkable manner the
lowest races of human beings. This resemblance is recognised by the
negro races, who call the gorilla and chimpanzee ‘hairy men,’ and
believe them to be descendants of outcast members of their own
species.</p>
<p>There are differences in structure between man and the apes,
just as there are differences in structure between the Caucasian
and the Caffre, or even between individual Caucasians or individual
Caffres. There are differences in structure and topography, often
very noticeable differences, even among members of the same family.
But in all of its essential characters, and extending often to
astonishing particulars, the structure of man is identical with
that of the anthropoid.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter4-footnote2" id="part1-chapter4-ref2" name=
"part1-chapter4-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>In external appearances the man-like races differ from men in
having a luxuriant covering of natural hair. But anthropoids differ
very much among themselves in this particular. The orang, usually
covered with long hair, is sometimes almost hairless. There are,
too, races of human beings whose bodies are covered with a
considerable growth of hair. The Todas (Australians) and Ainus
(aborigines of Japan) are noted for the hairiness of their bodies,
certain individuals among them being covered with a real fur,
especially on the lower limbs.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter4-footnote3" id="part1-chapter4-ref3" name=
"part1-chapter4-ref3">[3]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Individuals also often appear in every race with a remarkable
development of the hair. Adrian and his son Fedor, exhibited years
ago over Europe as ‘dog-men,’ are examples. The father was
completely covered with a thick growth of fine dirty-yellow hair
two or three inches long. Long tufts grew out of his nostrils and
ears, giving him a striking resemblance to a Skye terrier. Fedor,
and also his sister, were covered with hair like the father, but
another son was like ordinary men. The man-like races have also
longer arms in proportion to the height of the body than man
generally has. But this is also true of human infants and negroes.
The gibbon has relatively much longer arms than the other
anthropoids. It differs from the chimpanzee in this respect more
than the chimpanzee differs from man. When standing upright and
reaching down with the middle finger, the gibbon can touch its
foot, while the chimpanzee can reach only to the knee. Man
ordinarily reaches part way down the thigh, but negroes have been
known to have arms reaching to the knee-pan.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter4-footnote4" id="part1-chapter4-ref4" name=
"part1-chapter4-ref4">[4]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The skeleton of the African races contains many characters
recognised by osteologists as ‘pithecoid,’ or ape-like. It is
massive, the flat bones are thick, and the pelvis narrow. In the
manlike apes the large toe is opposable to the other four, and is
used by them much as the thumb is used. But this difference between
the two races of beings is just what might be expected from the
differences in their modes of life. Man has little need of this
opposability on account of his exclusively terrestrial life, while
to the ape it is indispensable on account of his arboreal
environment and life. ‘But there are,’ says Haeckel, ‘wild tribes
of men who can oppose the large toe to the other four just as if it
were a thumb, and even new-born infants of the most
highly-developed races of men can grasp as easily with their
hind-hands as with their forehands. Chinese boatmen row with their
feet, and Bengal workmen weave with them. The negro, in whom the
big toe is freely movable, seizes hold of the branches of trees
with it when climbing, just like the four-handed
apes’.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter4-footnote5" id=
"part1-chapter4-ref5" name=
"part1-chapter4-ref5">[5]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Many men have lost their arms by accident and have learned to
use their feet as hands with wonderful skill. Not many years ago
there died in Europe an armless violinist who had during his
lifetime played to cultured audiences in most of the capitals of
the world. Some of the most accomplished of penmen hold their pen
between their toes. The man-like apes live to about the same age as
man, and all of them, like man, have beards. The anthropoid beard,
too, like the human, appears at the age of sexual maturity. The
human beard often differs in colour from the hair of the scalp, and
whenever it does it has been observed to be invariably
lighter—never darker—than the hair on the scalp. This is true among
all races of men. The same rule and the same uniformity exists
among anthropoids. The races of mankind are divided into two
primary groups depending upon the shape of the head and the
character of the hair: the short-headed races (Brachycephali), such
as the Malays, Mongols, and Aryans, with round or oval faces,
straight hair, and vertical profiles; and the long-headed races
(Dolichocephali), with woolly hair and prognathous faces, such as
the Papuans and Africa races. The skin of the short-headed races is
orange or white, while the skin and hair of the long-headed races
are glossy black.</p>
<p>It is, at least, interesting that the orang and gibbon, who live
in Asia and its islands, where the brachycephalic races of men
supposedly arose, are themselves brachycephalic; and that the
gorilla and chimpanzee, who live in Africa, where the
dolichocephalic races chiefly live, are dolichocephalic. The
gorilla and chimpanzee also have, like the men and women of Africa,
black skin and hair; while the hair of the orang is a
reddish-brown, and its skin sometimes yellowish-white. The
dentition of the anthropoids and men is in all essentials
identical. They all have two sets of teeth: a set of milk-teeth,
twenty in number, and thirty-two permanent teeth, the permanents
consisting of two incisors, one canine, two premolars, and three
molars, in each half-jaw. Man has ordinarily twelve pairs of ribs
and thirty-two vertebrae. So has the orang. The other anthropoids
have thirteen pairs of ribs. But the number of ribs in both human
and anthropoid beings is not uniform, man occasionally having
thirteen pairs, and the gorilla fourteen. Man has also the same
number of caudal vertebrae in his rudimentary tail as the
anthropoid has. The hands and feet of anthropoids, bone for bone
and muscle for muscle, correspond with those of men, no greater
structural differences existing than among different species of
men. The human foot has three muscles not found in the human hand—a
short flexor muscle, a short extensor muscle, and a long muscle
extending from the fibula to the foot. All of these muscles are
found in the anthropoid foot just as in the foot of man. There are
also the same differences between the arrangement of the bones of
the anthropoid wrist and ankle as between the wrist and ankle bones
of man. Whatever set of anatomical particulars may be selected,
whether it be hands, arms, feet, muscles, skull, viscera, ribs, or
dentition, it is found that the anthropoid races and men are in all
essentials the same. The differences are such as have arisen as a
result of different modes of life, and such as exist between
different tribes of either group of animals. </p>
<p>‘The structural differences which separate man from the gorilla
and chimpanzee,’ says Huxley, in summing up the conclusion of his
brilliant inquiry into ‘Man’s Place in Nature,’ ‘are not so great
as those which separate the gorilla from the lower apes.’</p>
<p>‘The body of man and that of the anthropoid are not only
peculiarly similar,’ says Haeckel, ‘but they are practically one
and the same in every important respect. The same two hundred
bones, in the same order and structure, make up our inner skeleton;
the same three hundred muscles effect our movements; the same hair
clothes our skin; the same four-chambered heart is the central
pulsometer in our circulation; the same thirty-two teeth are set in
the same order in our jaws; the same salivary, hepatic, and gastric
glands compass our digestion; the same reproductive organs insure
the maintenance of our race’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter4-footnote6" id="part1-chapter4-ref6" name=
"part1-chapter4-ref6">[6]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>‘Not being able,’ says Owen in his paper on ‘The Characters of
Mammalia,’ ‘to appreciate or conceive of the distinction between
the psychical phenomena of a chimpanzee and of a Boschisman or of
an Aztec with arrested brain-growth, as being of a nature so
essential as to preclude a comparison between them, or as being
other than a difference in degree, I cannot shut my eyes to the
significance of that all-pervading similitude of structure—every
tooth, every bone, strictly homologous—which makes the
determination of the difference between <em>Homo</em> and
<em>Pithecus</em> the anatomist’s difficulty.’</p>
<p>‘If before the appearance of man on the earth,’ says Ward in his
‘Dynamic Sociology,’ ‘an imaginary painter had visited it, and
drawn a portrait embodying the thorax of the gibbon, the hands and
feet of the gorilla, the form and skull of the chimpanzee, the
brain development of the orang, and the countenance of
<em>Semnopithecus</em>, giving to the whole the average stature of
all of these apes, the result would have been a being not far
removed from our conception of the primitive man, and not widely
different from the actual condition of certain low tribes of
savages. The brain development would perhaps be too low for the
average of any existing tribe, and would correspond better with
that of certain microcephalous idiots and cretins, of which the
human race furnishes many examples.’</p>
<p>And it is not true, as is commonly supposed, that, after all
other resemblances between the human and anthropoid structures have
been made out, there still exists somewhere some undistinguishable
difference in the organic structure of their brains. All
differences in structure from time to time suspected or asserted to
exist between the brain of man and that of the man-like apes have
been one after another completely swept away. And it is now known
to all neurologists that the human and anthropoid brains differ
structurally in no particulars whatever, both of them containing
the same lobes, the same ventricles and cornua, and the same
convolutional outline. Even the posterior lobe, the posterior
cornu, and the hippocampus minor, so long triumphantly asserted to
be characteristic features of the human brain, have been pitilessly
identified in all anthropoids by the profound and terrible Huxley.
There is not an important fold or fissure in the brain of man that
is not found in the brain of the anthropoid. ‘The surface of the
brain of a monkey,’ says Huxley, ‘exhibits a sort of skeleton map
of man’s, and in the man-like apes the details become more and more
filled in, until it is only in minor characters that the
chimpanzee’s or the orang’s brain can be structurally distinguished
from man’s’.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter4-footnote7" id=
"part1-chapter4-ref7" name=
"part1-chapter4-ref7">[7]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The great difference physically between man and the anthropoids,
aside from man’s talented larynx and erect posture, lies in man’s
abnormal cranial capacity. The normal human cranium never contains
less than 55 cubic inches of space, while the largest gorilla
cranium contains only 34½ cubic inches. This is a difference of 20½
cubic inches. And 20½ cubic inches of thinking matter is an
alarming amount to be lacking in a single individual. But this
cranial gap between gorilla and man is deprived of some of its
significance by the fact that human crania sometimes measure 114
cubic inches, making a difference between the smallest and largest
human brains of 59 cubic inches. The difference between the gorilla
and the savage in cranial capacity is, therefore, <em>only about
one-third as great as the cranial chasm between the savage and the
sage</em>.</p>

<h3 id="part1-chapter5">V. Recapitulation.</h3>
<p>The anatomical gulf between men and apes does not exist. There
are, in fact, no gulfs anywhere, only gradations. All chasms are
completely covered by unmistakable affinities, in spite of the fact
that the remains of so many millions of deceased races lie hidden
beneath seas or everlastingly locked in the limy bosoms of the
continents. There are closer kinships and remoter kinships, but
there are kinships everywhere. The more intimate kinships are
indicated by more definite and detailed similarities, and the more
general relationships by more fundamental resemblances. All
creatures are bound to all other creatures by the ties of a varying
but undeniable consanguinity. </p>
<p>Man stands unquestionably in the primate order of animals,
because he has certain qualities of structure which all primates
have, and which all other animals have not: hands and arms and
nails, a bagpipe stomach, great subordination of the cerebellum, a
disc-like placenta, teeth differentiated into incisors, canines,
and molars, and pectoral milk glands.</p>
<p>Man is more closely akin to the anthropoid apes than to the
other primates on account of his immense brain, his ape-like face,
his vertical spine, and in being a true two-handed biped. The
manlike apes and men have the same number and kinds of teeth, the
same limb bones and muscles, like ribs and vertebrae, an atrophied
tail, the same brain structure, and a suspicious similarity in
looks and disposition. Men and anthropoids live about the same
number of years, both being toothless and wrinkled in old age. The
beard, too, in both classes of animals appears at the same period
of life and obeys the same law of variation in colour. Even the
hairs on different parts of the bodies of men and anthropoids, as
on the arms, incline at a like angle to the body surface. The hair
on the upper arm and that on the forearm, in both anthropoids and
men, point in opposite directions—toward the elbow. This
peculiarity is found nowhere in the animal kingdom excepting in a
few American monkeys.</p>
<p>Man’s mammalian affinities are shown in his diaphragm, his hair,
his four-chambered heart, his <em>corpus callosum</em>, his
non-nucleated blood-corpuscles, and his awkward incubation.</p>
<p>The fishes, frogs, reptiles, birds, and non-human mammals are
human in having two body cavities, segmented internal skeletons,
two pairs of limbs, skulls and spinal columns, red blood, brains,
and dorsal cords; and in possessing two eyes, two ears, nostrils,
and mouth opening out of the head. And finally all animals,
including man, are related to all other animal forms by the great
underlying facts of their origin, structure, composition, and
destiny. All creatures, whether they live in the sea, in the
heavens, or in subterranean glooms; whether they swim, fly, crawl,
or walk; whether their world is a planet or a water-drop; and
whether they realise it or not, commence existence in the same way,
are composed of the same substances, are nourished by the same
matters, follow fundamentally the same occupations, all do under
the circumstances the best they can, and all arrive ultimately at
the same pitiful end.</p>
<h3 id="part1-chapter6">VI. The Meaning of Homology.</h3>
<p>The similarities and homologies of structure existing between
man and other animals, and between other animals and still others,
are not accidental and causeless. They are not resemblances
scattered arbitrarily among the multitudinous forms of life by the
capricious levities of chance. That all animals commence existence
as an egg and are all made up of cells composed of the same
protoplasmic substance, and all inhale oxygen and exhale carbon
dioxide, and are all seeking pleasure and seeking to avoid pain,
are more than ordinary facts. They are filled with inferences. That
vertebrate animals, differing in externals as widely as herring and
Englishmen, are all built according to the same fundamental plan,
with marrow-filled backbones and exactly two pairs of limbs
branching in the same way, is an astonishing coincidence. That the
wing of the bird, the foreleg of the dog, the flipper of the whale,
and the fore-limb of the toad and crocodile, have essentially the
same bones as the human arm has is a fact which may be without
significance to blind men, but to no one else. The metamorphosis of
the frog from a fish, of the insect from a worm, and of a poet from
a senseless cell, are transformations simply marvellous in meaning.
And it is not easy, since Darwin, to understand how such lessons
could remain long unintelligible, even to stones and simpletons.
Not many generations have passed, however, since these revelations,
now so distinct and wonderful, fell on the listless minds of men as
ineffectually as the glories of the flower fall on the sightless
sockets of the blind.</p>
<p>It is hardly two generations since the highest intelligences on
the earth conceived that not only the different varieties of
men—the black, the white, and the orange—but all the orders and
genera of the animal world, and not only animals, but plants, had
all been somehow simultaneously and arbitrarily brought into
existence in some indistinct antiquity, and that they had from the
beginning all existed with practically the same features and in
approximately the same conditions as those with which and in which
they are found to-day. The universe was conceived to be a fixed and
stupid something, born as we see it, incapable of growth, and
indulging in nothing but repetitions. There were no necessary
coherencies and consanguinities, no cosmical tendencies operating
eternally and universally. All was whimsical and arbitrary. It was
not known that anything had grown or evolved. All things were
believed to have been given beginning and assigned to their
respective places in the universe by a potential and all-clever
creator. The serpent was limbless because it had officiously
allowed Eve to include in her dietary that which had been expressly
forbidden. The quadruped walked with its face towards the earth as
a structural reminder of its subjection to the biped, who was
supposed to be especially skilled in keeping his eyes rolled
heavenward. The flowers flung out their colours, not for the
benefit of the bugs and bees, and the stars paraded, not because
they were moved to do so by their own eternal urgings, but because
man had eyes capable of being affected by them. Man was an erect
and featherless vertebrate because his hypothetical maker was erect
and featherless. (I wonder whether, if a clam should conceive a
creator, it would have the magnanimity to make him an insect or a
vertebrate, or anything other than a great big clam.)</p>
<h3 id="part1-chapter7">VII. The Earth an Evolution.</h3>
<p>The world now knows—at least, the scientific part of it
knows—that these things are not true, that they are but the solemn
fancies of honest but simple-minded ancients who did the best they
could in that twilight age to explain to their inquiring instincts
the wilderness of phenomena in which they found themselves. The
universe is a process. It is not petrified, but flowing. It is
going somewhere. Everything is changing and evolving, and will
always continue to do so. The forms of life, of continents and
oceans, and of streams and systems, which we perceive as we open
our senses upon the world to-day, are not the forms that have
always existed, and they are not the forms of the eternal future.
There was a time, away in the inconceivable, when there was no life
upon the earth, no solids, and no seas. The world was an
incandescent lump, lifeless and alone, in the cold solitudes of the
spaces. There was a time—there must have been a time—when life
appeared for the first time upon the earth, simple cellules without
bones or blood, and without a suspicion of their immense and
quarrelsome posterity. There was a time when North America was an
island, and the Alleghany Mountains were the only mountains of the
continent. The time was—in the coal-forming age—when the
Mississippi Valley, from the Colorado Islands to the Alleghanies,
was a vast marsh or sea, choked with forests of equisetum and fern,
and swarming with gigantic reptiles now extinct. There was a time
when palms grew in Dakota, and magnolias waved in the semi-tropical
climate of Greenland and Spitzbergen. There was a time when there
were no Rocky Mountains in existence, no Andes, no Alps, no
Pyrenees, and no Himalayas. And that time, compared with the vast
stretches of geological duration, was not so very long ago, for
these mountains are all young mountains. The time was when Jurassic
saurians—those repulsive ruffians of that rude old time—represented
the highest intelligence and civilisation of the known universe.
There were no men and women in the world, not even savages, when
our ape-like forefathers wandered and wondered through the awesome
silences of primeval wilds; there were no railroads, steamboats,
telegraphs, telephones, typewriters, harvesters, electric lights,
nor sewing machines; no billionaires nor bicycles, no socialists
nor steam-heat, no ‘watered stock’ nor ‘government by injunction,’
no women’s clubs, captains of industry, labour unions, nor ‘yellow
perils’—there was none of these things on the earth a hundred years
ago. All things have evolved to be what they are—the continents,
oceans, and atmospheres, and the plants and populations that live
in and upon them.</p>
<p>There will come a time, too, looking forward into the future,
when what we see now will be seen no more. As we go backward into
the past, the earth in all of its aspects rapidly changes; the
continents dwindle, the mountains melt, and existing races and
species disappear one after another. The farther we penetrate into
the past, the stranger and the more different from the present does
everything become, until finally we come to a world of molten rocks
and vapourised seas without a creeping thing upon it. As it has
been in the past so will it be in time to come. The present is not
everlasting. The minds that perceive upon this planet a thousand
centuries in the future will perceive a very different world from
that which the minds of this day perceive—different arts, animals,
events, ideals, geographies, sciences, and civilisations. The earth
seems fixed and changeless because we are so fleeting. We see it
but a moment, and are gone. The tossing forest in the wrath of the
storm is motionless when looked at by a flash of lightning. The
same tendencies that have worked past changes are at work to-day as
tirelessly as in the past. By invisible chisels the mountains are
being sculptured, ocean floors are lifting, and continents are
sinking into the seas. Species, systems, and civilisations are
changing, some crumbling and passing away, others rising out of the
ruins of the departed. Mighty astronomical tendencies are secretly
but relentlessly at work, and immense vicissitudes are in store for
this clod of our nativity. The earth is doomed to be frozen to
death. In a few million years, according to astronomers, the sun
will have shrunken to a fraction of his present size, and will have
become correspondingly reduced in heat-giving powers. It is
estimated that in twelve or fifteen million years the sun, upon
whose mighty dispensations all life and activity on the earth are
absolutely dependent, will become so enfeebled that no form of life
on the earth will be possible. The partially-cooled earth itself is
giving up its internal warmth, and will continue to give it up
until it is the same temperature as the surrounding abysms, which
is the frightful negative of something like 270 centigrade degrees.
These are not very cheerful facts for those who inhabit the earth
to contemplate. But they that seek the things that cheer must seek
another sphere. No power can stay the emaciation of suns or the
thievery of enveloping immensities. Old age is inevitable. It is
far off, but it is as certain as human decay, and as mournful. In
that dreadful but inevitable time no living being will be left in
this world; there will be no cities nor states nor vanities nor
creeping things, no flowers, no twilights, no love, only a frozen
sphere. The oceans that now rave against the rocky flanks of the
continents will be locked in eternal immobility; the atmospheres,
which to-day drive their fleecy flocks over the azure meads of
heaven and float sweet sounds and feathered forms, will be, in that
terrible time, turned to stone; the radiant woods and fields, the
home of the myriads and the green play-places of the shadows, will,
like all that live, move, and breathe, have rotted into the
everlasting lumber of the elements. There will be no Europe then,
no pompous philosophies, no hellish rich, and no gods. All will
have suffered indescribable refrigeration. The earth will be a
fluidless, lifeless, sunless cinder, unimaginably dead and
desolate, a decrepit and pitiful old ruin falling endlessly among
heartless immensities, the universal tomb of the activities.</p>
<p>The universe is an evolution. Change is as extensive as time and
space. The present has come out of that which has been, and will
enter into and determine that which is to be. Everything has a
biography. Everything has evolved—<em>everything</em>—from the
murmur on the lips of the speechless babe to the soul of the poet,
and from the molecule to Jehovah.</p>
<h3 id="part1-chapter8">VIII. The Factors of Organic
Evolution.</h3>
<p>The animal kingdom represents one of the two grand branches of
the organic universe. It has been evolved—evolved in a manner as
simple and straightforward as it is revolting. It has all been
brought about by <em>partiality</em> or <em>selection</em>.
Generations of beings have come into existence. The individual
members of each generation have differed from each other—differed
in size, strength, speed, colour, shape, sagacity, luck, and
likelihood of life. No two beings, not even those born from the
same womb, are in all respects identical. Hardships have come. They
have come from the inanimate universe in the form of floods, fires,
frosts, accidents, diseases, droughts, storms, and the like; from
other species, who were competitors or enemies; and from
unbrotherly members of the same species. Some have survived, but
the great majority have perished. Only a fraction, and generally an
appallingly small fraction, of each generation of a species have
lived to maturity. The lobster lays 10,000 eggs in a season, yet
the mortality is such that the number of lobsters do not increase
from one year to another. The elephant is the slowest breeder of
all animals, yet, if they should all live, the offspring of a
single pair in 750 years would, according to Darwin, number nearly
19,000,000. It has been shown that at the normal rate of increase
of English sparrows, if none were to die save of old age, it would
take but twenty years for a single pair to give one sparrow to
every square inch in the State of Indiana.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter8-footnote1" id="part1-chapter8-ref1" name=
"part1-chapter8-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup> A single cyclops (one
of the humbler crustaceans) may have 5,000,000 descendants in a
season. One aphis will produce 100 young, and these young will
reproduce in like manner for ten generations in a season, when, if
they should all live, there would be a quintillion of young. A
female white ant, when adult, does nothing but lie in a cell and
lay eggs. She lays 80,000 eggs a day regularly for several months.
An oyster lays 2,000,000 eggs in a season, and if all these eggs
came to maturity a few dozen oysters might supply the markets of
the world. The tapeworm is said to produce the incredible number of
1,000,000,000 ova, and some of the humbler plants three times this
number of spores. If each egg of the codfish should produce an
adult, a single pair in twenty-five years would produce a mass of
fish larger than the earth. Lower forms of life are even more
prolific than the higher. Maupas said that certain microscopic
infusorians which he studied multiplied so rapidly that, if they
should continue to multiply for thirty-eight days, and all of them
should live, any one of them would produce a mass of protoplasm as
big as the sun.</p>
<p>Those of each generation that have died have been inferior, or
unfitted to the environment in which they found themselves. Those
that have survived have been superior, superior in
something—bigness, cunning, courage, virtue, vitality, strength,
speed, littleness, or ferocity—something that has related them
advantageously to surrounding conditions. The surviving remnant of
each generation have become the progenitors of the next generation,
and have transmitted, or tended to transmit, to their offspring the
qualities of their superiority. This winnowing has gone on in each
generation of living beings during many millions of years—almost
ever since life commenced to be on the earth. Some have continued
themselves, and others have died childless. The environment of each
species has been an immense sieve, and only the superior have gone
through it. Different environments have emphasised different
qualities of structure and disposition, and have thus given rise to
permanent varieties in survival. These varieties, through the
accumulated effects of many generations of selection, have diverged
into species; species, after a still longer series of selections,
have evolved into genera; genera have evolved into families;
families into orders; and so on. In this simple, terrible manner
have all the branches of organic beings (thanks to the horrors of a
million ages) been brought into existence.</p>
<p><em>Variation</em>, therefore, which furnishes variety in
offspring; <em>Heredity</em>, which tends to perpetuate
peculiarities by causing offspring to resemble more or less the
characters of their parents; and <em>Environment</em>, which
determines the character of the selections, are the three factors,
and the only three factors, in organic evolution.</p>

<h3 id="part1-chapter9">IX. The Evidences of Organic
Evolution.</h3>
<p>That the forms of life to-day found on the earth have come into
existence by the evolution of the more complex forms from the
simpler, and of these simpler forms from still simpler, through the
ever-operating law of Selection, is a necessary conclusion from the
following facts:</p>
<p>1. The existence in the animal world of all grades of
structures, from the humblest possible protozoan, whose body
consists of a single simple speck, to the most powerful and complex
of mammals. There are estimated to be something like a million
species of animals living on the earth to-day. There may be several
times this number. These species are linked together by millions of
varieties, and are so related to each other that they may be all
gathered together into various genera; these genera may be grouped
into families, the families into orders, and the orders into seven
or eight great primary phyla. By taking existing species and adding
to them the extinct species of the rocks, and placing them all
according to their structural affinities, it is possible to arrange
them in the form of a tree with the various phyla, orders,
families, genera, and species, branching and rebranching from the
main trunk. The existence of structures, so graduated as to render
such an arrangement possible, is in itself suggestive of a common
relationship and origin.</p>
<p>2. Evolution is suggested by the similarities and homologies of
structure found throughout the animal kingdom. Some of these
similarities and homologies have already been mentioned. They are
everywhere—remoter and more fundamental, some of them, others
closer and more detailed. To the untrained mind, which sees
surfaces only, and not even surfaces well, the animal world is an
interminable miscellany of forms. But to the biologist, who looks
deeper and with immense acumen over the whole field of animal life,
there are only seven or eight different types of structure in the
entire animal world. These seven or eight types correspond with the
primary classes, or phyla, into which animals are divided, viz.,
protozoa, sponges, celenterates, echinoderms, worms, mollusks,
arthropods, and vertebrates. However widely the members of each of
these great groups may differ among themselves in colour, size,
habits of life, and the like, the members of each group all
resemble each other fundamentally. Moles differ from monkeys, bats
from men, and birds from crocodiles and toads. They differ
enormously. But they are all vertebrates with red blood, double
body cavities, backbones, two pairs of limbs, and five fingers on
each limb. When they are looked at superficially, there is not much
similarity between a water-strider and a butterfly or between a
stag-beetle and a gnat. But they are all, in reality, built
according to the same plan. Like all other insects, they have six
legs, a sheath-like skeleton, and bodies characteristically divided
into head, thorax, and abdomen. It is the same with all other great
classes of beings. All worms resemble each other; and so do all
mollusks, although they may differ in particulars as widely as
nautiluses and clams. Echinoderms have a radiate structure,
celenterates and sponges are vase-like in shape, and protozoa are
one-celled. The differences in structure among the members of a
group consist in different modifications of a fundamental type.
Among the vertebrates the fore-limb may be an arm, a leg, a wing, a
shovel, a flipper, or a fin. But in all cases it is the same
organ—that is, the same implement modified to serve different ends.
Take the mouth-parts of insects. In the grasshopper and cricket
these parts are fitted for grinding; in the moths and butterflies
they are fashioned into long tubes for sucking the sweets of
flowers; in the mosquito they form an elaborate apparatus for
drilling and drinking; and in the mayfly the mouth-parts, though
present, are not used at all. In all of these animals these parts
are essentially the same, although differing so much in their forms
and purposes that the unscientific can scarcely be made to believe
they are fundamentally alike. There is no fact more familiar to the
biologist or more frequently met with in the fields of animal
morphology than the fact that the same general type may be hammered
into dozens, or hundreds, or even thousands, of different patterns
by the incessant industry of its surroundings, and that the same
organic part may be moulded into various implements serving totally
different ends by the environmental vicissitudes of time and space.
On the hypothesis that the members of each group of animals
possessing common characteristics, whether the group be large or
small, have sprung from a common ancestry, and that the differences
in structure have arisen as a result of differences in environment,
the similarities and homologies of structure existing among animals
are perfectly intelligible. But on any other supposition they are
inexplicable.</p>
<p>3. Evolution is suggested by the remarkable series of phenomena
presented by embryology. There are at least four facts in the
developmental history of every creature which can hardly be
accounted for on any other supposition than that of organic
evolution.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, the fact that every animal, above the lowest,
individually passes through an evolution between the beginning of
its existence and its maturity. Terrestrial beings are not born,
like Minerva, full-grown. They grow. They evolve. They commence
close down to the very atoms. And from this lowly genesis they
rise, through a series of marvellous changes, to that high state of
perfection and greatness from which they descend to
dissolution.</p>
<p>If we knew by actual observation as little concerning the
evolution of individuals as we do of the evolution of species—if we
had always been used to seeing animals, including ourselves, in
full bloom—had never watched the tadpole, the pupa, and the babe
pass through their wonderful metamorphoses on their way to
maturity, it would probably be just as hard for many minds to
believe that animals evolve individually to be what they are as it
is for them to believe that species have grown to be what they are.
In the case of individuals, however, the evolution takes place
right before our eyes largely, while the evolution of species goes
on so slowly and stretches back so far into the past that it can
only be inferred.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, the fact that animals, no matter how much they
may differ from each other at maturity, all begin existence at the
same place. Every animal commences its organic existence as an
egg—as a one-celled animal—as an organism identical in structure
with the simplest protozoan. The ova of whales ‘are no larger than
fern seeds.’ The eggs of the coral, the crab, the ape, and the man
are so precisely alike that the highest powers of the microscope
cannot distinguish between them.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, the fact that the members of the same great
group of animals in their individual development pass through
similar stages of evolution. The ‘worm’ stage in the development of
most insects and the ‘fish’ stage of frogs are well known.</p>
<p>There are no more remarkable instances of individual evolution
in the whole range of animal life. The fish, the reptile, the bird,
the dog, and the human being—all vertebrates, in short—cannot for
some time after their embryonic commencement be distinguished from
each other. ‘The feet of lizards and mammals, the wings and feet of
birds, and the hands and feet of men,’ says the illustrious Von
Baer, as quoted by Darwin, ‘all arise from the same fundamental
form’.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter9-footnote1" id=
"part1-chapter9-ref1a" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref1a">[1a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>‘It is quite in the later stages of development,’ says Huxley,
‘that the human being presents marked differences from the ape,
while the latter departs as much from the dog in its development as
the man does’.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter9-footnote2" id=
"part1-chapter9-ref2" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Not only frogs, but reptiles, birds, and mammals, including man,
all have gills at a certain stage in their embryonic development.
Nearly all the lower invertebrate animals are hermaphroditic—that
is, in the body of each animal is found the two kinds of sex organs
which in the higher animals exist in distinct animals. And frogs,
birds, and other higher animals, which as adults are unisexual,
have, as an inheritance from these primitive forms, hermaphroditic
embryos.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter9-footnote3" id=
"part1-chapter9-ref3a" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref3a">[3a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, the fact that the structural stages through
which animals in embryo pass correspond in a wonderful manner with
the permanent structures of those lower forms which extend serially
back to the beginnings of life. It is the proudest boast of the
embryologist that he is able to know the route through which any
species has come to be what it is by a simple study of the
individual evolution of its members. Each animal repeats in its
individual evolution the evolution of its species. This
recapitulation is not always complete—is, in fact, frequently
vague, sometimes circuitous, and often broken or abbreviated.
Processes requiring originally centuries or thousands of years to
accomplish are here telescoped into a few months, or even days. It
is not strange that the process is imperfect. But so firmly is the
belief in the correspondence of ontogeny and phylogeny fixed in the
minds of modern biologists that, in determining the classification
and affinities of any particular animal, more reliance is placed on
the facts of embryology than on those of adult structure.</p>
<p>The first thing that an animal becomes after it is an egg—unless
it is a one-celled animal, in which case it remains always an
egg—is two cells; these two cells become four; these four become
eight; and so on, until the embryo becomes a many-celled ball,
consisting of a single layer of cells surrounding a fluid interior.
A dimple forms in the cell layer on one side of this ball, and, by
deepening to a hollow, changes the ball into a double-walled sac.
This is the gastrula—the permanent structure of the sponges and
celenterates, and an (almost) invariable stage in the larval
development of all animals above the sponges and celenterates. The
gastrula becomes a worm (or an insect or a fish through the worm)
by elongation and enlargement, and by the development of the
endoderm, which is the inner layer of the cell wall, into organs of
nutrition and reproduction, and by the development of the ectoderm,
which is the outer cell layer, into organs of motion and
sensation.</p>
<p>The embryonic development of a human being is not different in
kind from the embryonic development of any other animal. Every
human being at the beginning of his organic existence is a
protozoan, about <small><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>125</sub></small> inch in
diameter; at another stage of development he is a tiny sac-shaped
mass of cells without blood or nerves, the gastrula; at another
stage he is a worm, with a pulsating tube instead of a heart, and
without head, neck, spinal column, or limbs; at another stage he
has, as a backbone, a rod of cartilage extending along the back,
and a faint nerve cord, as in amphioxus, the lowest of the
vertebrates; at another stage he is a fish with a two-chambered
heart, mesonephric kidneys, and gill-slits with gill arteries
leading to them, just as in fishes; at another stage he is a
reptile with a three-chambered heart, and voiding his excreta
through a cloaca like other reptiles; and finally, when he enters
upon post-natal sins and actualities, he is a sprawling, squalling,
unreasoning quadruped. The human larva from the fifth to the
seventh month of development is covered with a thick growth of hair
and has a true caudal appendage, like the monkey. At this stage the
embryo has in all thirty-eight vertebrae, nine of which are caudal,
and the great toe extends at right angles to the other toes, and is
not longer than the other toes, but shorter, as in the ape.</p>
<p>These facts are unmistakable. There is a reason for everything,
and there is a reason for these transformations through which each
generation of living beings journeys. The individual passes through
them because the species to which he belongs has passed through
them. They represent ancestral wanderings. As if to emphasise the
kinship of all of life’s forms and to render incontrovertible the
fact of universal evolution, Nature compels every individual to
commence existence at the same place, and to recapitulate in his
individual evolution the phylogenetic journeyings of his
species.</p>
<p>4. That existing forms of life have been evolved from other
forms, and that these ancestral forms have been different from
those derived from them, is shown by the occasional appearance of
antecedent and abandoned types of structure among the offspring of
existing species. Occasionally a human child is born strangely
unlike its parents, but bearing an unmistakable resemblance in
looks and disposition to his great-grandfather or some other remote
ancestor. This is <em>atavism</em>, that tendency to revert to
ancestral types which is prevalent among all animals. We may think
of it figuratively as a flash of indecision when Nature hesitates
for a moment whether to adopt a new form of structure or cling to
the old and tried. Horses and mules are sometimes born with three
toes on each foot, and zebra-like stripes on their legs and
shoulders; and domestic pigeons, such as are naturally black, red,
or mottled, occasionally produce offspring with blue plumage and
two black wing-bars, like the wild rock-dove, from which all
domestic breeds have sprung. In man the cheekbone and the frontal
bone of the forehead consist normally each of a single bone. But in
children and human embryos these bones are always double, as is
normally the case in adults among some of the anthropoids and other
mammals. Gills appear regularly in the embryos of reptiles, birds,
and mammals, and human young are sometimes born with gill-slits on
the neck. There are times when, owing to inaccurate or incomplete
embryological development, these fish-like characteristics are so
perfect at birth as to allow liquids, on being swallowed, to pass
out through them and trickle down on the outside of the neck. Many
muscles are occasionally developed in man which are normal in the
apes and other mammals. As many as seven different muscular
variations have been found in a single human being, every one of
which were muscles found normally in the structure of the
apes.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter9-footnote1" id=
"part1-chapter9-ref1b" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref1b">[1b]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>5. Closely akin to atavism, which is the occasional persistence
of ancestral types of character, is the regular occurrence of
vestigial organs or structures, organs which in ancestral forms
have definite functions, but which in existing species, owing to
changed conditions, are rudimentary and useless. On the back of
each ankle of the horse are two splints, the atrophied remains of
the second and fourth toes. Similar vestiges of two obsolete toes
are also found just back of the wrists and ankles on all the
two-toed ungulates, such as the cow and sheep. In the body of the
whale where hind-limbs would naturally be, there are found the
anatomical ruins of these organs in the form of a few diminutive
bones. The same thing is true in the sirenians. In the Greenland
whale there are remnants of both femur and tibia in the region of
the atrophied hind-limbs. The snakes are limbless, but the pythons
and boas have internal remnants of hind-limbs and sometimes even
clawed structures representing toes. The so-called ‘glass-snake’ or
‘joint-snake’ (which is really a limbless lizard) has four complete
internal limbs. Young turtles, parrots, and whalebone whales have
teeth, but the adults of these animals are toothless. Cows, sheep,
deer, and other ruminants, never have as adults any upper incisors,
but these teeth are found in the foetal stages of these animals
just under the gums. The female frog has rudimentary male
reproductive organs, and the male has corresponding vestiges of
female organs. Similar remnants of the reproductive structures
exist in many other animals. They represent stages in the
transition from the hermaphroditism of primitive animals to the
unisexuality of the higher forms, the separation of the sex organs
into those of male and female having come about through the decay
of one set of structures in each individual.</p>
<p>For reasons which it is not necessary to mention here,
biologists believe that insects all originated from a common
parental form, with two pairs of wings and six legs. Insects all
retain their original allowance of legs, but in many species one or
the other pair of wings has become more or less degenerated. In the
whole order of flies the back pair of wings is represented by a
couple of insignificant knobs. In the Strepsiptera, a sub-order of
beetles, the front-wings are similarly reduced, being mere twisted
filaments. Many parasites, such as fleas and ticks, whose mode of
life renders organs of aerial locomotion unnecessary, are entirely
wingless. The insects of small isolated islands are also largely
without wings, the proportion of wingless species being much larger
than among insects inhabiting continents. This is due to their
greater liability on small land masses of being carried out to sea
and drowned, owing to the feebleness and uncertainty of insect
flight. On the island of Madeira, out of the 550 species found
there, 220 species no longer have the power of flight.</p>
<p>Air-breathing animals—amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals—have normally a pair of lungs—a right one and a left one.
But in snakes and snake-like lizards, where the body is very
slender and elongated, only one lung, sometimes the right one, and
sometimes the left, is fully developed. The right ovary is likewise
aborted in all birds, the left one yielding all the eggs. The
swifts and frigate birds live almost their whole lives long on the
wing, and the legs of these birds have grown so short and weak and
rudimentary, as a result of their constant life in the air, that
they can scarcely walk. The chimney swift is said never to alight
anywhere except on the sooty inner walls of the chimney where its
nest is. Its food consists of insects which it gathers in the air,
and the few dead twigs used in making its nest are nipped from the
tree while the bird continues its flight. The ostriches,
cassowaries, and many other birds, have, on the other hand,
developed their legs at the expense of their wings. The ostrich is
said to be able to outrun the horse, but it has no power of flight,
although it has wings and wing muscles, and even the skin-folds
covering the wings corresponding to those of birds that fly. But
its whole flying apparatus is in ruins. The rudimentary hind-toe of
birds is a vestigial organ, and so are the claws which appear on
the thumb and first finger of all young birds. So also are the
rudiments of eyes in cave crickets, fishes, and other inhabitants
of total darkness. The flounder and other so-called flat fishes
swim straight up, as ordinary fishes do, when young. But as they
grow they incline more and more to one side, and finally swim
entirely on their side, the eye on the lower side migrating around,
and joining the other on the upper side of the head.</p>
<p>About the first thing a human infant does on coming into the
world is to prove its arboreal origin by grasping and spitefully
clinging to everything that stimulates its palms. A little
peeperless babe an hour old can perform feats of strength with its
hands and arms that many men and women cannot equal. It can support
the entire weight of its body for several seconds hanging by its
hands. Dr. Robinson, an English physician, found as a result of
sixty experiments on as many infants, more than half of whom were
less than an hour old, that with two exceptions every babe was able
to hang to the finger or to a small stick, and sustain the whole
weight of the body for at least ten seconds. Twelve of those just
born held on for nearly a minute. At the age of two or three weeks,
when this power is greatest, several succeeded in sustaining
themselves for over a minute and a half, two for over two minutes,
and one for two minutes and thirty-five seconds. The young ape for
some weeks after birth clings tenaciously to its mother’s neck and
hair, and the instinct of the child to cling to objects is probably
a survival of the instinct of the young ape. I believe it is
Wallace who relates somewhere an incident which illustrates the
instinct of the young simian to cling to something. Wallace had
captured a young ape, and was carrying it to camp, when the little
fellow happened to get its hands on the naturalist’s whiskers,
which it mistook, evidently, for the hirsute property of its
mother, and, driven by the powerful instinct of self-preservation,
it hung on to them so desperately it could scarcely be pulled
loose. Many mammals are provided with a well-developed muscular
apparatus for the manipulation of their ears. But in man there does
not exist the same necessity for auricular detection of enemies,
and while these muscles still exist, and are capable of being used
to a slight extent by occasional individuals, they are generally so
emaciated as to be useless.</p>
<p>Another vestigial organ in the body of man, and one of
significance from the standpoint of morphology, is the tail. The
tail is an exceedingly unpopular part of the human anatomy, most
men and women being unwilling to admit that they have such an
appendage. But many a person who has hitherto dozed in ignorance on
this matter has learned with considerable dismay, when he has for
the first time looked upon the undraped lineaments of the human
skeleton, that man actually has a tail. It consists of three or
four (sometimes five) small vertebrae, more or less fused, at the
posterior end of the spinal column. That this is really a
rudimentary tail is proved beyond a doubt by the fact that in the
embryo it is highly developed, being longer than the limbs, and is
provided with a regular muscular apparatus for wagging it. These
caudal muscles are generally represented in grown-up people by
bands of fibrous tissue, but cases are known where the actual
muscles have persisted through life.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter9-footnote4" id="part1-chapter9-ref4" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref4">[4]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The nictitating membrane, which in birds and many reptiles
consists of a half-transparent curtain acting as a lid to sweep the
eye, is in the human eye dwindled to a small membranous remnant,
draped at the inner corner. The growth of hair over the human body
surface may be regarded, in view of the sartorial habits of man, as
a vestigial inheritance from hairy ancestors. One of the most
notorious of the vestigial organs of man is the vermiform appendix,
a small slender sac opening from the large intestine near where the
large intestine is joined by the small intestine. In some animals
this organ is large and performs an important part in the process
of digestion. But in man it is a mere rudiment, not only of no
possible aid in digestion, but the source of frequent disease, and
even of death.</p>
<p>There are in all, according to Darwin, about eighty vestigial
organs in the human body. But these organs occur everywhere
throughout the animal kingdom. There is not an order of animals,
nor of plants either, without them. They are necessary facts
growing out of evolution. Organic structures are the result of
adjustment to surrounding conditions. The continual changes in
environment to which all organisms are exposed necessitate
corresponding changes in structure. And the vestiges found in the
bodies of all animals represent parts which in the previous
existence were useful and necessary to a complete adjustment of the
organism, but which, owing to a change of emphasis in surroundings,
have become useless, and consequently shrunken. They are the
obsolete or obsolescent parts of animal structure—parts which have
been outgrown and superseded—the ‘silent letters’ of morphology.
They sustain the same relation to the individual organism as dead
or dwindling species sustain to a fauna. They furnish indisputable
proof of the kinship and unity of the animal world.</p>
<p>6. It is only on the supposition that the life of the earth has
evolved step by step with the evolution of the land masses, and
that the forms of life from which existing forms were evolved were
dispersed over the earth at a time when physiographic conditions
were very different from what they are now, that it is possible to
account for the peculiar manner in which animals are distributed
over the earth. The cassowary is a flightless bird of the ostrich
order inhabiting Australia and the islands to the north of it. This
bird is found nowhere else in the world, and each area has its own
particular species. The same things are also true of the kangaroo.
It is found over a similar region, with a different species
occupying each land mass. Now, on the hypothesis of special
creation there is no thinkable reason why these animals should be
divided, as they are, into distinct species, and restricted to this
particular region. But on the hypothesis of evolution it is
perfectly plain. All of these regions at one time were united with
one another, and were subsequently submerged in part, forming
islands. Each group of animals, being isolated from every other
group and subjected to somewhat different conditions, developed a
style of departure from the original type of structure different
from that of every other group in response to the peculiar
conditions operating upon it. This has led, in the course of
centuries of selection, to the formation of distinct species such
as exist to-day.</p>
<p>Lombock Strait, a narrow neck of water between Bali and Lombock
Island, and Macassar Strait, separating Celebes from Borneo, are
parts of a continuous passage of water which in remote times
separated two continents—an Indo-Malayan continent to which
belonged Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula; and an
Austro-Malayan continent, now represented by Australia, Celebes,
the Moluccas, New Guinea, Solomon’s Islands, etc. Wallace first
announced this ancient boundary, and it has been called ‘Wallace’s
line.’ He was led to infer its existence by the fact which he
observed as he travelled about from island to island, that, while
the faunas of these two regions are as wholes very different from
each other, the faunas of the various land patches in each area
have a wonderful similarity. Australia is a veritable museum of old
and obsolete forms of both plants and animals. Its fauna and flora
are made up prevailingly of forms such as have on the other
continents long been superseded by more specialised species. No
true mammals, excepting men and a few rats, lived in Australia when
Englishmen first went there. The most powerful animals were the
comparatively helpless marsupials. The explanation of these
remarkable facts is probably this: The Australian continent, which
formerly included New Guinea and other islands to the north, has
not been connected with the other land masses for a very long
period of time. The development upon the other continents of the
more powerful mammals, especially of the ungulates and the
carnivora, resulted in the extermination of the more helpless forms
from most of the earth’s surface. But Australia, protected by its
isolation, has retained to this day its old-fashioned forms of
life, neither land animals nor plants having been able to navigate
the intervening straits. This supposition is strengthened by the
fact that fossil remains of marsupials are to-day found scattered
all over the world, while, with the exception of the American
opossums, living marsupials are found only in Australia and its
islands. There is to-day not a single survivor of these
once-numerous races in either Europe, Asia, or Africa. Similar
facts of distribution are furnished by the lemurs—those small,
monkey-like animals with fox faces, which are sometimes called
‘half-apes,’ since they are supposed to be the link connecting the
true apes with lower forms. Fossil lemurs are found in both America
and Europe, but lemurs are now extinct in both continents. Those of
America were probably exterminated by the carnivora, who are known
to be very fond of monkey meat of all kinds. The European lemurs
seem to have migrated southward into eastern Africa at a time when
Madagascar formed a part of the mainland. ‘There they have been
isolated, and have developed in a fashion comparable to that which
has occurred in the case of the Australian marsupials. Of fifty
living species, thirty are confined to Madagascar, and the lemurs
are there exceedingly numerous in individuals. Outside of
Madagascar they only maintain a precarious footing in forests or on
islands, and are usually few in number’.<sup><small><a href=

<p>If the earth were peopled by migrations from Ararat, it would
require a good deal of intellectual legerdemain to show why the
sloths are confined to South America and the monotremes to
Australia and its islands. The reindeer of northern Europe and
Asia, and the elk and caribou of Arctic America, are so much alike
they must have descended from a common ancestry, and been developed
into distinct species since the separation of North America and
Eurasia. The same thing is probably also true of the puma and
jaguar, who inhabit the middle latitudes of the New World, and the
lion, tiger, and leopard, occupying like latitudes of the Old
World. They all belong to the cat family, and represent divergences
from a common feline type of structure. The camel does not exist
normally outside of northern Africa and central and western Asia.
And when the camel-like llama of South America first became known
to zoologists, it was a problem how this creature could have become
separated so far from the apparent origin of the camel family. But
since then fossil camels have been found all over both North and
South America. And it has even been suspected that perhaps America
was the original home of the camel, and that, like the horse, the
camel migrated to the eastern hemisphere at a time when the eastern
and western land masses were connected. The foxes, hares, and other
mammals of the upper Alps, also many Alpine plants, are like those
of the Arctic regions. The most probable explanation of these
resemblances is that these Alpine species climbed up into these
inhospitable altitudes, and were left stranded here on this island
of cold, when their relatives, on the return of warmth at the close
of the glacial period, retreated back to the ice-bound fastnesses
around the pole. It is for a similar reason, probably, that the
flora of the upper White Mountains resembles that of Labrador.</p>
<p>7. One of the strongest pieces of evidence bearing on evolution
that is furnished by any department of knowledge is that furnished
by geology. It is the evidence of the rocks. Geology is, among
other things, a history of the earth. This history has been written
by the earth itself on laminae of stone. It is from these records
that we learn incontestably the order in which the forms of life
have made their appearance on the earth.</p>
<p>Three-fourths of the surface of the earth is sea. Over the
surface of the remaining fourth, excepting in mountainous places,
is a layer of soil, varying from a few feet to a few hundred feet
in depth. Beneath this coverlet of soil, extending as far as man
has penetrated into the earth, is rock. Excepting in regions
overflowed by lava poured out from beneath, or along the backbones
of continents where the surface rocks have been upheaved into folds
and carried away by denudation, the rocks immediately beneath the
soil, to a thickness often of thousands of feet, are in the form of
layers, or sheets, arranged one above another. These rocks are
called sedimentary rocks, as distinguished from the unlaminated
rocks of the interior. They have been formed at the bottom of the
sea, and have, hence, all been formed since the condensation of the
oceans. They have been formed out of the detritus of continents
brought down by the rivers and the accumulated remains of animal
and vegetal forms which have slowly settled down through the
waters. They are the successive cemeteries of the dead past. Such
rocks are now forming over the floors of all oceans—forming just as
they have formed throughout the long eons of geological history.
Along the axes of ancient mountains and in deep-cut canyons the
rock layers are exposed to a thickness of thousands of feet, in
some cases thirty or forty thousand feet. Here they lie, piled up,
one on top of another, the great, broad pages upon which are
written the long, dark story of our planet. It is the mightiest and
most everlasting of all annals—the autobiography of a world. It is
possible, by studying these rock records, to know not only the kind
of life that lived in each age, but a good deal regarding the
conditions in which that life lived and passed away. Just as the
naturalist is able, from a single bone of an unknown animal, to
reconstruct the entire animal and to infer something of its
surroundings and habits of life, and as the archeologist, by going
back to the graves of deceased races and digging up the dust upon
which these races wrought, is able to tell much of their history
and characteristics, so the geologist, by studying the bones of
those more distant civilisations, the civilisations sandwiched
among the fossiliferous rocks, is able to know, not only just the
kind of life that lived in each age, but, by comparing the species
of successive strata, can construct with astonishing fulness the
genealogical outline of the entire life process. The succession of
life forms as they appear in the rocks, with a sketch of their
probable genealogy, is traced elsewhere in this chapter. It is only
necessary to say here that the order in which the forms of life
appear in the sedimentary strata is that of a gradually increasing
complexity. The invertebrates appear first; then the fishes, the
lowest of the vertebrates; after these come the amphibians;
following these the reptiles; and finally the birds and
mammals.</p>
<p>8. There is another reason for a belief in evolution furnished
by geology, but of a somewhat different kind from that just stated.
It consists in the fact that there are found in the rocks series or
grades of structures, which fit with amazing accuracy on to the
structures of existing species. Now, this is precisely what,
according to the evolutional hypothesis, is to be expected. For, if
evolution is true, existing species represent the tops of things.
They are the existing and visible parts of processes which extend
indefinitely back into the past, and whose deceased stages may
reasonably be expected to be found fossil in the earth. Considering
the youth and inexperience of paleontology and the torn and
incoherent character of the record, it is surprising that
anatomists have been able to accomplish what they have
accomplished. In many cases—notably, those of man, the snail, the
crocodile, and the horse—antecedent forms of structure have been
found in almost unbroken gradations leading back to types differing
immensely from their existing representatives. Bones and fossils of
men have been found buried beneath the alluvium of rivers, under
old lava-beds, and in caves, crusted over by the deposits of
percolating waters. Many such fossils are found in quaternary
rocks, along with the bones of animals still living and some
extinct. Some of these remains indicate unmistakable affinities
with the ape. The most celebrated of these discoveries is the
fossil of an erect ape-man (<em>Pithecanthropus erectus</em>),
found by a Dutch Governor on the island of Java in 1894. This
fossil, in the shape and size of the head and in its general
structure, strikes about as near as could be the middle between man
and ape. That it is the fossil of an ambiguous form is indicated by
the fact that, when it was examined by a company of twelve
specialists at Berlin soon after its discovery, three of them
declared it to be the remains of an individual belonging to a low
variety of man; three others thought it was a large anthropoid;
while the other six held that it was neither man nor anthropoid,
but a genuine connecting link between them. It is discussed at
length by Haeckel in ‘The Last Link,’ a paper read before the
International Congress of Zoology, at Cambridge, in 1898. ‘It is,’
says the veteran biologist, ‘the much-sought “missing link”
supposed to be wanting in the chain of primates which stretches
unbroken from the lowest catarhine to the most highly developed
man.’ Associated with this fossil ape-man were the fossils of the
elephant, hyena, and hippopotamus, none of which any longer exist
in that part of the world, also the fossil remains of two orders of
animals now extinct. The genealogy of the crocodile has been traced
by Huxley, through all intermediate stages, back to the giant
reptiles of the early Tertiary.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter9-footnote5" id="part1-chapter9-ref5" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref5">[5]</a></small></sup>And the pedigree of the
horse has been even more completely worked out by the indefatigable
Marsh. In the museum of Yale University may be seen the fossil
history of this splendid ungulate, from the time it was a clumsy
little quadruped only 14 inches high, and with four or five toes on
each foot, down to existing horses. The earliest known ancestor of
the horse, the eohippus, lived at the beginning of the Eocene
epoch. It had five toes, almost equal, on each front foot (four
toes behind), and was about the size of a fox. The orohippus, which
lived a little later, had four toes on each front-foot, and three
behind. The mesohippus, found in the Miocene, had three toes and
one rudimentary toe on each front-foot, and three toes behind. It
was about the size of a sheep. The miohippus, which is found later,
had three toes on each of its four feet, with the middle toe on
each foot larger than the other two. The pliohippus, living in the
Pliocene epoch, had one principal toe on each foot, and two
secondary toes, the two secondary toes not reaching to the ground.
It was about the size of a donkey. Existing horses have one toe on
each foot—the digit corresponding to the big middle finger—and the
ruins of two others in the form of splints on the back of each
ankle. In the embryo of the horse these splints are segmented, each
of them, into three phalanges. Fossil remains representing all
stages in the development of the horse have been found in the
regions about the upper waters of the Missouri River.</p>
<p>It is an important fact that the types of structure forming any
series grow more and more generalised as the distance from the
present increases, and that different lines of development, when
traced back into the past, often converge in types which combine
the main characters of various existing groups. The horses,
rhinoceroses, and tapirs, great as are the differences among them
now, can be traced back step by step through fossil forms, their
differences gradually becoming less marked, until ‘the lines
ultimately blend together, if not in one common ancestor, at all
events into forms so closely alike in all essentials that no
reasonable doubt can be held as to their common origin.’ ‘The four
chief orders of the higher mammals—the primates, ungulates,
carnivora, and rodents—seem to be separated by profound gulfs, when
we confine our attention to the representatives of to-day. But
these gulfs are completely closed, and the sharp distinctions of
the four orders are entirely lost, when we go back and compare
their extinct predecessors of the Cenozoic period, who lived at
least three million years ago. There we find the great sub-class of
the placentals, which to-day comprises more than two thousand five
hundred species, represented by only a small number of
insignificant pro-placentals, in which the characters of the four
divergent orders are so intermingled and toned down that we cannot
in reason do other than consider them as the precursors of those
features. The oldest primates, the oldest ungulates, the oldest
carnivora, and the oldest rodents, all have the same skeletal
structure and the same typical dentition (forty-four teeth) as
these pro-placentals; all are characterised by the small and
imperfect structure of the brain, especially of the cortex, its
chief part, and all have short legs and five-toed, flat-soled
(plantigrade) feet. In many cases among these oldest placentals it
was at first very difficult to say whether they should be classed
with the primates, ungulates, carnivora, or rodents, so very
closely and confusedly do these four groups, which diverge so
widely afterwards, approach each other at that time. Their common
origin from a single ancestral group follows
incontestably’.<sup><small><a href="#part1-chapter9-footnote6" id=

<p>9. Man is the most powerful and influential of animals. He rules
the world—rules it with a sovereignty more despotic and extensive
than that hitherto exercised by any other animal. Many races of
beings are, and have been for centuries, completely dominated by
him. These races, during their long subjection, have been changed
and transformed by man in a wonderful manner through his control of
their power to breed. All domestic animals have come from wild
animals; they have been derived by a process of selective evolution
conducted by man himself. By continually choosing as the
progenitors of each generation those with qualities best suited to
his whims and purposes, man has evolved races as different from
each other in appearance and structure, and as different from the
original species, as many groups which, in the wild state,
constitute distinct species; indeed, man has in some cases created
entirely new species, both of plants and animals—species that breed
true and are what biologists call ‘good’—by his own selections.</p>
<p>There are something over 150 different varieties of the domestic
pigeon. Some of these varieties—as many as a dozen, Mr. Darwin
thinks—differ from each other sufficiently to be reckoned, if they
are considered solely with reference to their structures, as
entirely distinct species. The carrier, for instance, the giant of
the pigeons, measures 17 inches from bill-tip to the end of its
tail, and has a beak 1 <small><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></small>
inches long. Around each eye is a large dahlia-like wattle, and
another large wattle is on the beak, giving the beak the appearance
of having been thrust through the kernel of a walnut. The tumbler
is small, squatty, and almost beakless. It has the preposterous
habit of rising high in the air and then tumbling heels over head.
The roller, one of the many varieties of the tumbler, descends to
the ground in a series of back somersaults, executed so rapidly
that it looks like a falling ball. The runt is large, weighing
sometimes as much as the carrier. The fantail has thirty or forty
feathers in its tail, while all other varieties have only twelve or
fourteen, the normal number for birds. The trumpeter, so named on
account of its peculiar coo, has an umbrella-like hood of feathers
covering its head and face, and its feet are so heavily feathered
that they look like little wings. In the correct specimens of this
variety the feathers have to be clipped from the face before the
birds can see to feed themselves. The pouter has the absurd habit
of inflating its gullet to a prodigious size, and the Jacobin wears
a gigantic ruff. The homing pigeon has such a strong attachment for
its cote that it will travel hundreds of miles, sometimes as many
as 1,400 miles, in order to reach the home from which it has been
separated. But it is not simply in their colour, size, habits, and
plumage, that pigeons vary. There are corresponding differences in
their structures, in the number of their ribs and vertebrae, in the
shape and size of the skull, in the bones of the face, in the
development of the breast-bone, and in the length of the neck,
legs, and bill. Pigeons also differ in the shape and size of their
eggs, and in their dispositions and voice. ‘There is,’ says Huxley
in summing up his discussion of the great variety in these birds,
‘hardly a particular of either internal economy or external shape
which has not by selective breeding been perpetuated and become the
foundation of a new race’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter9-footnote7" id="part1-chapter9-ref7" name=
"part1-chapter9-ref7">[7]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>All of the 150 different varieties of domestic pigeons have been
evolved by human selection during the past three or four thousand
years from the blue rock-doves which to-day inhabit the seacoast
countries of Europe.</p>
<p>What is true of pigeons is also true largely of most of the
other races associated with man—of cats, cattle, horses, sheep,
swine, goats, fowls, and the like. All varieties of the domestic
chicken—the clumsy Cochin with its feather-duster legs, the tall
and stately Spanish, the great-crested Minorca, the Dorking with
its matchless; comb and wattle, the almost combless Polish, the
blue Andalusian, the gigantic Brahma, the tiny Bantam, the
Wyandottes in all colours (black, white, buff, silver, and golden),
the magnificent Plymouth Rocks, and the exceedingly pugnacious
Game-cock—these and dozens of other varieties, all flightless, have
come from the jungle-bird whose morning clarion still greets Aurora
from the wilds of distant India. The dog is a civilised wolf, and
the wild-boar is the progenitor of the oleaginous swine. The Merino
and South Down breeds of sheep have come from the same stock in the
last century and a half. In 1790 a lamb was born on the farm of
Seth Wright in Massachusetts. It had a long body and short, bowed
legs. It was noticed that this lamb could not follow the others
over the fences. The owner thought it would be a good thing if all
his sheep were like it. So he selected it to breed from. Some of
its offspring were like it, and some were like the ordinary sheep.
By continual selection of those with long bodies and short legs the
ancon breed of sheep was finally produced. In 1770 in a herd of
Paraguay cattle a hornless male calf appeared, and from this
individual in a similar way came the stock of Muleys. The
occasional appearance of horned calves and lambs among the
offspring of hornless breeds of cattle and sheep are examples of
atavism indicating the presence of a vestigial tendency to breed
true to their horned ancestors. The Hereford cattle originated as a
distinct variety about 1769 through the careful selections of a
certain Englishman by the name of Tompkins. All domesticated
quadrupeds, except the elephant, have come from wild species with
erect ears, the ears acting as funnels to harvest the sound-waves.
But there are few of them in which there is not one or more
varieties with drooping ears—cats in China, horses in parts of
Russia, sheep in Italy, cattle in India, and pigs, dogs, and
rabbits in all long-civilised lands. We are so accustomed to seeing
dogs and pigs with pendent ears that we are surprised to know there
are varieties with erect ears. The goldfish is a carp, and in its
native haunts in the waters of China it has the colour of the carp.
The golden hue seen in the occupants of our aquaria has been given
to this fish by the Chinese through the continual selection of
certain kinds. The goldfish, almost as much as the pigeon, has been
the sport of fanciers, and the strangest varieties have resulted.
Some have outlandishly long fins, while others have no dorsal fin
at all. Some are streaked and splotched with gold and scarlet;
others are pure albinos. One of the most monstrous varieties has a
three-lobed tail-fin, and its eyeballs, without sockets, are on the
outside of its head. All of our common barnyard fowls—turkeys,
ducks, geese, and chickens—are flightless, but the varieties from
which the domesticated forms have come all have functional wings,
two of these varieties crossing continents in their annual
migrations.</p>
<p>Not only animals, but plants also, many of them, have been
greatly changed by man in his efforts to adapt them to his uses as
food, ornamentation, and the like. On the seaside cliffs of Chili
and Peru may still be found growing the wild-potato—the small,
tough, bitter ancestor of the mammoth Burbank, Peerless, Early
Rose, and the nearly two hundred other varieties of this matchless
tuber found in the gardens of civilised man. The cabbage, kale,
cauliflower, and kohlrabi are all modifications of the same wild
species (<em>Brassica oleracea</em>), the cauliflower being the
developed flower, kohlrabi the stalk, and kale and cabbage the
leaves. The peach and the almond, Darwin thinks, have also come
from a common ancestral drupe, the peach being the developed fruit,
and the almond the seed. There are nearly 900 different varieties
of apples, varying in the most wonderful manner in size, colour,
flavour, texture, and shape, but all of them probably derived from
the little, sour, inedible Asiatic crab. The many times ‘double’
roses of our gardens have come from the five-petalled wild-rose of
the prairies. The cultivated varieties of viburnum and hydrangea
have showy corymbs of infertile flowers only, but the wild forms
from which the domestic varieties have been derived have only a
single marginal row of showy infertile flowers surrounding a mass
of inconspicuous fertile flowers. It has been due to their efforts
to please men that bananas, pineapples, and oranges have got into
the habit of neglecting to produce seeds. There are certain species
of grapes that are seedless, also seedless sugar-cane, and a
seedless apple has just been announced by horticulturists. The
development of domesticated plants is only in its infancy, and it
is probably impossible even for the most agile imagination to dream
of the miracles the horticulturist is destined to work in the ages
to come. There is every reason to believe that seedless varieties
of all our common fruits will ultimately be produced, and that in
size, flavour, nutrient constituents, and appearance, they will be
developed into forms utterly different from existing varieties.
Just within the last few years the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has developed a cotton-plant immune to the bacterial diseases of
the soil, which had completely driven the cotton-raising industry
out of large districts of the South. The cultivation of many of the
cereals has gone on so long, and has proceeded so far, that their
origin is lost in antiquity.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is possible for new varieties and species to
be evolved is a question, therefore, which does not need to depend
for reply wholly upon theory. It is known to have taken place; and
the process by which the different varieties of domestic animals
and plants have been evolved—domestic selection—is not different in
principle from the process of natural selection, the chief
operation by which life in general, both plant and animal, is
assumed to have been evolved.</p>
<p>10. There are other reasons for a belief in organic evolution,
but the last one I shall mention is the fact that the theory of
organic evolution harmonises with the known tendencies of the
universe as a whole. The organic kingdoms of the earth—animals and
plants—are as truly parts of the terrestrial globe as the inorganic
kingdom is; and as such they share in, and are actuated by, the
same great tendency or instinct as that which actuates the whole.
Nine-tenths of the substance of all animals and plants is oxygen,
hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen—the very elements which make up the
entire ocean and air, and enter largely into the composition of the
continents. The human body, which has essentially the same chemical
composition as the bodies of animals in general, is made up of four
solids, five gases, and seven metals—in all, sixteen elements of
the something like seventy which constitute the entire planet. ‘In
the past, man appeared to be a creature foreign to the earth, and
placed upon it as a transitory inhabitant by some incomprehensible
power. The more perfect insight of the present day sees man as a
being whose development has taken place in accordance with the same
laws as those that have governed the development of the earth and
its entire organisation—a being not put upon the earth accidentally
by an arbitrary act, but produced in harmony with the earth’s
nature, and belonging to it as do the flowers and the fruits to the
tree which bears them.’ Animals are not outside of, nor distinct
from, the universe, as one might suspect who has listened much to
the recital of tradition so long accepted as science. They are more
or less detached portions of the planet earth which move over its
surfaces and through its fluids and multiply, but which in their
phenomena obey the same laws of chemistry and physics as those in
accordance with which the rest of the universe acts. Animals are
moulds through which digressing matters from the soil, sea, and sky
pass on rounds of eternal itineracy.</p>
<p>Now, the earth as a planet is in process of evolution. Not many
things are more certain than this. The earth has come out of fire.
It has <em>grown</em> to be what it is. Its mountains, valleys,
plains, seas, shores, islands, lakes, rivers, and continents—these
were not always here. They have been evolved. Not only the earth,
but the entire family of spheres of which the earth is a member—the
solar system—are all evolving. Mr. Spencer never did anything more
profound than when he demonstrated in his ‘Law and Cause of
Progress’ the universal migration of things from a condition of
homogeneity toward a condition of greater and greater
heterogeneity. The whole universe, or as much of it as can be
examined by terrestrial instruments, has probably evolved out of
the same primordial matters. The organic part of the earth has
evolved, therefore, and is destined to continue to evolve, because
it is a part of a whole whose habit or ambition it is to
evolve.</p>
<p>The evidence is overwhelming. The theory of organic evolution is
sustained by a mass of facts not less authoritative and convincing
than that which supports the Copernican theory of the worlds.
Evolution is, in fact, a doctrine so apparent that it only needs to
be honestly and intelligently looked into to be accepted
unreservedly. It is, indeed, <em>more</em> than a
<em>doctrine</em>. It is a <em>known</em> fact. It is a
<em>necessary effect</em> of the <em>conditions known to exist</em>
among the animals and plants of the earth. If beings <em>vary</em>
among themselves generation after generation, if only the
<em>fittest</em> of each generation <em>survive</em> and if the
survivors tend to <em>transmit</em> to their offspring the
qualities of their superiority (and the animals and plants of the
earth are known to do continually all of these things), then it
follows <em>with mathematical certainty</em> that evolution is
going on, and that it will continue to go on as long as these
conditions continue. It is inevitable. It could not be otherwise.
We would <em>know</em> that evolution were going on among organisms
where these conditions existed, even though we had never observed
it.</p>
<p>The boldest and most enthusiastic opponents of evolution have
always been those with the least information about it. But the
evidence is accumulating so rapidly, and is being drawn up in such
unanswerable array, that, if it is not already the case, it will
not be many years before it will be an intellectual reproach for
anyone to discredit, or to be known to have discredited, this
splendid and inspiring revelation.</p>

<h3 id="part1-chapter10">X. The Genealogy of Animals.</h3>
<p>Life originated in the sea, and for an immense period of time
after it commenced it was confined to the place of its origin. The
civilisations of the earth were for many millions of years
exclusively aquatic. It has, indeed, been estimated that the time
required by the life process in getting out of the water—that is,
that the time consumed in elaborating the first species of land
animals—was much longer than the time which has elapsed since then.
I presume that during a large part of this early period it would
have seemed to one living at that time extremely doubtful whether
there would ever be on the earth any other kinds of life than the
aquatic. And if those who to-day weave the fashionable fabrics of
human philosophy, and who know nothing about anything outside the
thin edge of the present, had been back there, they would no doubt
have declared confidently, as they looked upon the naked continents
and the uninhabited air and the sea teeming with its peculiar
faunas, that life upon solids or in gases, life anywhere, in fact,
except in the sea, where it had always existed, and to which alone
it was adapted, was absolutely, and would be forever, impossible;
and that feathered fishes and fishes with the power to run and
skip, and especially ‘sharks’ competent to walk on one end and
jabber with the other, were unthinkable nonsense. Life originated
in the sea for the same reason that the first of the series of
so-called ‘civilisations’ which have appeared in human history
sprang from the alluvium of the Euphrates and the Nile, because the
conditions for bringing life into existence were here the most
favourable. The atmosphere was incompetent to perform such a task
as the inventing of <em>protoplasm</em> and there was no land above
the oceans.</p>
<p>The first forms of life were one-celled—simple, jelly-like dots
of almost homogeneous plasm—the <em>protozoa</em>. These primitive
organisms were the common grandparents of all beings. From them
evolved, through infinite travail and suffering, all of the orders,
families, species, and varieties of animals that to-day live on the
earth, and all those that have in the past lived and passed away.
By the multiplication and specialisation of cells, and the
formation of cell aggregates, the sponges, celenterates, and flat
worms were developed from the protozoa.<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter10-footnote1" id="part1-chapter10-ref1" name=
"part1-chapter10-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup> The connecting links
between the one-celled and the many-celled animals consist of a
series of colonial forms of increasing size and complexity, some of
which may be found in every roadside ditch and pool, while others
are extinct. The development of these many-celled organisms
(metazoa) from one-celled organisms was a perfectly natural
process, a process which takes place in the initial evolutions of
every embryo. There is no more mystery about it than there is about
any other act of association. All association is simply a matter of
‘business.’ Many-celled organisms are colonies, or societies, of
more or less closely co-operating one-celled organisms, and they
have come into existence in obedience to the same laws of economy
and advantage as have those more modern societies of metazoa known
as nations, communities, and states, the organised bodies of men,
ants, and millionaires.</p>
<p>The sponges are the lowest of the many-celled animals. They
consist of irregular masses of loosely associated cells, hopelessly
anchored to the sea-floor. They represent the social instinct in
embryo. The cells are but slightly specialised, and each cell leads
a more or less independent existence. The sponge stands at about
that stage of social integration and intelligence represented by
those stupendous porifera which cover continents and constitute the
‘social organisms’ of the civilised world. The nutritive system of
sponges consists of countless pores opening from the surface into a
common canal within, through which ever-waving cilia urge the
alimental waters. In the celenterates the cells arrange themselves
in the form of a cup with one large opening into and from the
vase-like stomach. The unsegmented worms are flat and sac-like,
with bilateral symmetry and the power to move about, but not
tubular, as are the true worms. They are bloodless, like the
celenterates and sponges.</p>
<p>From the flat worms developed the annelid worms, animals
perforated by a food canal and possessing a body cavity filled with
blood surrounding this canal. The body cavity is the space between
the walls of the body and the alimentary canal, the cavity which in
the higher animals contains the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, etc.
The worms and all animals above them have this cavity. The worms
and all animals above them also have, as an inheritance from the
flat worms, bodies with bilateral symmetry—that is, bodies with two
halves similar. This peculiarity was probably acquired by the flat
worms, and so fastened upon all subsequently evolved species, as a
result of pure carelessness. It probably arose out of the habit of
using continually, or over and over again, the same parts of the
body as fore and aft. It has been facetiously said that if it had
not been for this habit, so inadvertently acquired by these humble
beings so long, long ago, we would not to-day be able to tell our
right hand from our left. In the worm is found the beginning of
that wonderful organ of co-ordination, the brain. The brain is a
modification of the skin. It may weaken our regard for this
imperial organ to know that it is, in its morphology, akin to nails
and corns. But it will certainly add to our admiration for the
infinite labours of evolution to remember that the magnificent
thinking apparatus of modern philosophers was originally a small
sensitive plate developed down in the sea a hundred million years
ago on the dorsal wall of the mouths of primeval worms.</p>
<p>From the worms developed all of the highest four phyla of the
animal kingdom—the echinoderms, the mollusks, the arthropods, and
the chordate animals, the last of which were the progenitors of the
illustrious vertebrates. The lowest of the mollusks are the snails,
and from these humble tenants of our ponds and shores sprang the
headless bivalves and the giant jawed cuttles. The mollusks were
for a long time after their development the mailed monarchs of the
sea, and shared with the worms the dominion of the primordial
waters. But after the development of the more active arthropods,
especially the crustaceans, the less agile worms and mollusks
rapidly declined. Existing worms and mollusks are remnants of once
powerful and populous races.</p>
<p>From the worms also developed the arthropods, the
water-breathing crustaceans and the air-breathing spiders and
insects. The crustaceans came early, away back in the gray of the
Silurian period, just about the time North America was born. North
America lay, a naked, V-shaped infant, in the regions of Labrador
and Canada. The crustaceans rapidly superseded the mollusks as
rulers of the sea, attaining, in extreme species, a length of four
or five feet. The spiders and Insects came into existence toward
the latter part of the Silurian period,<sup><small><a href=
"#part1-chapter10-footnote2" id="part1-chapter10-ref2" name=
"part1-chapter10-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup> probably
contemporaneous, or nearly so, with the appearance of land
vegetation. The spiders and insects were the aborigines of the land
and air. They are the only races of living beings, except the
original inhabitants of the sea, who ever invaded and settled an
unoccupied world. The earliest land fossils so far found are the
fossils of scorpions. But the existence of a sting among the
structural possessions of these animals indicates that there were
already others who contended with them for supremacy in the new
world. The first insects were the masticating insects, insects such
as cockroaches, crickets, grasshoppers, dragon-flies, and beetles.
They are found abundantly in the Devonian and Carboniferous rocks.
The licking insects (bees) and the pricking insects (flies and
bugs) appeared first in the Mesozoic Era, and the sipping insects
(butterflies) in the Cenozoic. The flower-loving insects (the bees
and butterflies) came into the world at the same time as did the
flowers. The wings of insects may be modifications of the gills
used by insect young in respiration during their aquatic existence.
They are, hence, very different in origin from the wings of birds,
which are the modified fore-legs of reptiles.</p>
<p>The most important class of animals arising out of the worms, on
account of their distinguished offspring, were the hypothetical
cord animals. The only existing species allied to these animals is
the amphioxus, a strange, unpromising-looking creature, half worm
and half fish, found in the beach sands of many seas. It has white
blood and a tubular heart. It is without either head or limbs, and
looks very much like a long semitransparent leaf, tapering at both
ends. But it has two unmistakable prophecies of the vertebrate
anatomy: a cartilaginous rod, pointed at both ends, extending along
the back, and above this, and parallel to it, a cord of nerve
matter. These are the same positions occupied by the spinal column
and spinal cord in all true vertebrates. That the amphioxus is a
genuine relative of the ancestor of the vertebrates is also shown
by the fact that these simple forms of column and cord possessed by
amphioxus are precisely the forms assumed by the spinal column and
spinal cord in the embryos of all vertebrates, including man.</p>
<p>From these quasi-vertebrates developed the fishes—first (after
the scaleless, limbless lampreys) the sharks with spiny scales and
cartilaginous skeleton, and after these the lung fishes and the
bony fishes, with flat, horny scales and skeletons of bone. From
the beginning of the Devonian age, when fishes first came into
prominence, till the rise of the great reptiles in the Triassic
time, fishes were the dominant life of the sea. In the fishes first
appeared jaws, a sympathetic nervous system, red blood, backbone,
and the characteristic two pairs of limbs of vertebrates.</p>
<p>The lung fishes (Dipneusta), a small order of strange
salamander-like creatures which live ingeniously on the borderland
between the liquid and the land, may be looked upon as
physiological, if not morphological, links between the fishes and
the frogs. They combine the characters of both fishes and frogs,
and zoologists have been tempted to make a separate class of them,
and place them between the two classes to which they are related.
They are like fishes in having scales, fins, permanent gills, and a
fish-like shape and skeleton. They resemble frogs in having lungs,
nostrils, an incipiently three-chambered heart, a pulmonary
circulation, and frog-like skin glands. There are three genera with
several species. One genus (Neoceratodus) is found in two or three
small rivers of Queensland, Australia; another (Protopterus) lives
in the Gambia and other rivers of Africa; and the third
(Lepidosiren) inhabits the swamps of the Amazon region. They all
breathe ordinarily by means of gills, like true fishes, but have
the habit of coming frequently to the surface and inhaling air. The
air-bladder acts as an incipient lung in supplementing respiration
by gills. They all live in regions where a dry season regularly
converts the watercourses into beds of sand and mud. During the
season of drought these strange animals build for themselves a
cocoon or nest of mud and leaves. This cocoon is lined with mucus,
and provided with a lid through which air is admitted. Here they
lie in this capsule throughout the hot southern summer, from August
to December, breathing air by means of their lungs and living upon
the stored-up fat of their tails, until the return of the wet
season, when they again live in the rivers and breathe water in
true piscatorial fashion. These capsules have often been carried to
Europe, and opened 3,000 miles from their place of construction
without harming the life within.</p>
<p>Here, in these eccentric denizens of the southern world, we find
the beginnings of a grand transformation—a transformation in both
structure and function, a transformation made necessary by the
transition from life in the water to life in the air, a
transformation which reaches its maturity in the higher
air-breathing vertebrates, where the simple air-sac of the fish
becomes a pair of lobed and elaborately sacculated lungs,
performing almost exclusively the function of respiration, and the
gills change into parts of the ears and lower jaw.</p>
<p>The air-bladder of ordinary fishes, which is used chiefly as a
hydrostatic organ to enable the fish to rise and fall in the water,
is probably the degenerated lung of the lung fishes.</p>
<p>From the lung fishes or allied forms developed the amphibians,
the well-known fish quadrupeds of our bogs and brooks. The
amphibians are genuine connectives—living links between the life of
the sea and the life of the land. In early life they are fishes,
with gills and two-chambered hearts. In later life they are
air-breathing quadrupeds, with legs and lungs and three-chambered
hearts. Here is evolution, plenty of it, and of the most tangible
character. And it takes place right before the eyes. The
transformation from the fish to the frog is, however, no more
wonderful than the embryonic transformations of other vertebrates.
It is simply more apparent, because it can be seen. The lungs of
amphibians and the lower reptiles are simple sacks opening by a
very short passage into the mouth. Some amphibians, as the axolotl
of Mexican lakes, ordinarily retain their gills through life, but
may be induced to develop lungs and adapt themselves to terrestrial
life by being kept out of the water. Others, as the newts, which
ordinarily develop lungs, may be compelled to retain their gills
through life by being forced to remain uninterruptedly in the
water. The black salamander, inhabiting droughty regions of the
Alps, brings forth its young bearing lungs, and only a pair at a
time. But if the young are prematurely removed from the body of the
mother and placed in the water, they develop gills in the ordinary
way. These are remarkable instances of elasticity in the presence
of a varying environment.</p>
<p>In the amphibians the characteristic five-toed or five-fingered
foot, which normally forms the extremities of the limbs of all
vertebrates except fishes, is first met with. It was this
pentadactyl peculiarity of the frog, inherited by men and women
through the reptiles and mammals, that gave rise to the decimal
system of numbers and other unhandy facts in human life. The
decimal system arose out of the practice of early men performing
their calculations on their fingers. This method of calculating is
still used by primitive peoples all over the world. The sum of the
digits of the two hands came, in the course of arithmetical
evolution, to be used as a unit, and from this simple beginning
grew up the complicated system of tens found among civilised
peoples. It has all come about as a result of amphibian initiative.
Our very arithmetics have been predetermined by the anatomical
peculiarities of the frog’s foot. If these unthinking foreordainers
of human affairs had had four or six toes on each foot instead of
five, man would no doubt have inherited them just as cheerfully as
the number he did inherit, and the civilised world would in this
case be to-day using in all of its mathematical activities a system
of eights or twelves instead of a system of tens. A system of
eights or twelves would be much superior in flexibility to the
existing system; for eight is a cube, and its half and double are
squares; and twelve can be divided by two, three, four, and six,
while ten is divisible by two and five only.</p>
<p>How helpless human beings are—in fact, how helpless all beings
are! How hopelessly dependent we are upon the past, and how
impossible it is to be really original! What the future will be
depends upon what the present is, for the future will grow out of,
and inherit, the present. What the present is depends upon what the
past was, for the present has grown out of, and inherited, the
past. And what the past was depends upon a remoter past from which
it evolved, and so on. There is no end anywhere of dependence,
either forward or backward. Every fact, from an idea to a sun, is a
<em>contingent link in an eternal chain</em>.</p>
<p>From the amphibians (probably from extinct forms, not from
living) there arose the highest three classes of vertebrates—the
true reptiles, the birds, and the mammals—all of whom have lungs
and breathe air from the beginning to the end of their days. Gills,
as organs of breathing, disappear forever, being changed, as has
been said, into parts of the organs of mastication and hearing. In
the reptiles first appear those organs which in the highest races
overflow on occasions of tenderness and grief, the tear glands.
These organs are, however, in our cold-blooded antecedents, organs
of ocular lubrication rather than of weeping. There are but four
small orders of existing reptiles—snakes, turtles, lizards, and
crocodilians. These are the pygmean descendants of a mighty line,
the last of a dynasty which during the greater part of the Mesozoic
ages was represented by the most immense and powerful monsters that
have ever lived upon the earth. Mesozoic civilisation was
pre-eminently saurian. Reptiles were supreme everywhere—on sea and
land and in the air. Their rulership of the world was not so bloody
and masterful as man’s, but quite as remorseless. Imagine an
aristocracy made up of pterosaurs (flying reptiles), with teeth,
and measuring 20 feet between wing-tips; great plesiosaurs (serpent
reptiles) and ichthyosaurs (fish reptiles), enormous bandits of the
seas; and dinosaurs and atlantosaurs, giant land lizards, 30 feet
high and from 50 to 100 feet in length. A government of demagogs is
bad enough, as king-ridden mankind well know, but dragons would be
worse, if possible. The atlantosaurs were the largest animals that
have ever walked upon the earth. They were huge plant-eaters
inhabiting North America. It has been surmised that one of these
behemoths ‘may have consumed a whole tree for breakfast.’ It was
the mighty saurians of the Mesozoic time who brought into
everlasting subordination the piscatorial civilisation of the
Devonian and carboniferous ages.</p>
<p>Toward the latter part of the Reptilian Age, and somewhere along
about the time of the appearance of hard-wood forests, came the
birds, those beautiful and emotional beings who, in spite of human
destructiveness, continue to fill our groves and gardens with the
miracles of beauty and song. The bird is a ‘glorified reptile.’ How
the ‘slow, cold-blooded, scaly saurian ever became transformed into
the quick, hot-blooded, feathered bird, the joy of creation,’ is a
considerable mystery, yet we know no reason for believing that the
transformation did not take place. Although in their external
appearance and mode of life birds and reptiles differ so widely
from each other, yet, in their internal structure and embryology,
they are so much alike that one of the brightest anatomists that
has ever lived (Huxley) united them both into a single class under
the name Sauropsida. It might naturally be supposed that the birds
are descendants of the flying reptiles, the pterosaurs. But this
may not be true. The pterosaurs were structurally much further
removed from the birds than were certain extinct terrestrial
reptiles. The fact that birds and pterosaurs both had wings has
really nothing to do with the case. For the wings of reptiles, we
almost know, were not homologous with the wings of birds. The
bird’s wing is a feathered fore-leg; the wing of the reptile was an
expanded skin stretching from the much-elongated last finger
backwards to the hind-leg and tail. Wings, it may be remarked in
passing, have had at least four different and distinct beginnings
in the animal kingdom, represented by the bats, the birds, the
reptiles, and the insects. This does not include the parachutes of
the so-called flying squirrels, lemurs, lizards, phalangers, and
fishes.</p>
<p>The first birds had teeth and vertebrated tails. The
archeopteryx, which is the earliest toothed bird whose remains have
yet been found, was about the size of a crow. It had thirty-two
teeth and twenty caudal vertebrae. Two specimens of it have been
found in the Jurassic slates of Bavaria. One of these fossils is in
the British Museum, and the other in the Museum of Berlin. Other
toothed birds have been found fossil by Dr. Mudge in the cretaceous
chalk of North America. These last had short, fan tails like
existing birds.</p>
<p>From the toothed birds developed the beaked birds—the
keel-breasted birds (the group to which most existing birds belong)
and the birds with unkeeled breasts, <em>i.e.</em>, the
ostrich-like birds. The ostrich-like birds are runners. They have
rudimentary wings, and the keel of the breast-bone, which in the
keel-breasted birds acts as a stay for the attachment of the wing
muscles, is lacking. The ostrich-like birds are probably degenerate
flyers, the flying apparatus having become obsolete through disuse.
The feathers of birds are generally supposed to be the modified
scales of reptiles.</p>
<p>The most brilliant offspring of the reptiles were the mammals,
animals capable of a wider distribution over the face of the earth
than the cold-blooded reptiles, on account of their hair and their
warm blood. Cold-blooded animals of great size are able to inhabit
but a small zone of the existing earth’s surface—the torrid belt.
They cannot house themselves during the seasons of cold, as men
can; nor escape to the tropics on the wings of the wind, as do the
birds; nor bury themselves in subaqueous mud, as do the frogs,
snakes, and crustaceans. During the Mesozoic period, when
cold-blooded reptiles of gigantic size flourished over a wide area
of the earth’s surface, the planet was far warmer than now.
Animals, therefore, like the mammals (or birds), capable of
maintaining a fixed temperature regardless of the thermal
fluctuations of the surrounding media, are the only animals of
large size and power capable of uninterrupted existence over the
greater part of the surface of the existing earth. The pre-eminent
life of the Cenozoic time was mammalian. But the decline and fall
of the saurian power was not wholly due to the rise of the more
dynamic mammals. It was in part due, no doubt, to adverse
conditions of climate, and also to the fact that mammals and birds
guard their eggs, and saurians do not.</p>
<p>The lowest of the mammals are the monotremes, animals which
blend in a marvellous manner the characteristics of birds,
reptiles, and mammals. Only two families of these old-fashioned
creatures are left, the echidna and the duck-bill
(ornithorhynchus), both of them found on or near that museum of
biological antiquities, Australia. They are covered with hair and
suckle their young like other mammals, but they have only the
rudiments of milk glands, and they lay eggs with large yolks from a
cloaca, like the reptiles and birds. The duck-bill hides its eggs
in the ground, but the echidna hatches its eggs in a small external
brooding pouch, periodically developed for this purpose. The young
of the monotremes feed on the oily perspiration which exudes from
the body of the mother. The monotremes first appear in the
fossiliferous rocks of the Triassic Age.</p>
<p>From the monotreme-like mammals developed the marsupial mammals,
animals possessing a purse-like pouch on the after part of the
abdomen, in which they carry their young. The young of marsupials
are born in an extremely immature state, and are carried in this
pouch in order to complete their development. The young of the
kangaroo, an animal as large as a man, are only about an inch in
length when they are born. They are carried for nine months after
their birth in the marsupium of the mother, firmly attached to the
maternal nipple. The marsupials came into existence during the
Jurassic Age, and during the next age, the Cretaceous, they arose
to considerable power. During this latter age they were found on
every continent. But they have been almost exterminated by their
more powerful descendants.</p>
<p>From the marsupials developed the placental mammals, animals so
called because their young are developed within the parental body
in association with a peculiar nourishing organ called the
placenta. From the herbivorous marsupials developed the almost
toothless edentates, the rodents, or gnawing animals, the
sirenians, the cetaceans, and the hoofed animals, or ungulates. The
sirenians are fish-like animals with two flippers, and are often
called sea-cows. They resemble whales in many respects, and are
sometimes classed with them. They are plant-eaters exclusively, and
are found grazing along the bottoms of tropical estuaries and
rivers. They have tiny eyes, teeth fitted for grinding (not
spike-like as in the whales), and a strong affection for their
young, the mother, when pursued, often carrying her little one
under her flippers. An immense sirenian, known as Steller’s
manatee, was discovered on the Behring Islands, along the
Kamschatka coast, in 1741. Twenty-seven years afterwards not one of
them was left, all having been murdered by the Russian sailors. The
sirenians are probably degenerate forms of land quadrupeds, having
lost their hind-limbs and developed the fish-like shape in adapting
themselves to aquatic conditions. They appear first in the Eocene
Age.</p>
<p>Among the most interesting derivatives of the herbivorous
marsupials, because the most aberrant, are the whales. They are
true mammals—have warm blood, breathe the air with lungs, and
suckle their young like other mammals. But, like the sirenians,
they live in the surface of the waters, and have flippers and a
fish-like tail and form. They differ from the sirenians, however,
in being carnivorous, in having inguinal instead of pectoral milk
glands, and in being structurally less like quadrupeds. They
probably degenerated from land quadrupeds during the Jurassic
period, and, owing to their longer residence in the waters, have
become further removed from the quadrupedal type than the
sirenians. Whales have two limbs, the hind-limbs having disappeared
as a result of the pre-eminent development of the tail. The tails
of whales and sirenians are flattened horizontally, not vertically,
as in fishes.</p>
<p>Out of generalised forms of hoofed animals now extinct developed
the odd-toed and even-toed races of existing ungulates. The
original ungulates had five hoofs on each foot, and were highly
generalised in their structure. From these original five-toed forms
have arisen the variously hoofed and variously structured tribes of
existing ungulates: the five-toed elephant, the four-toed tapir and
hippopotamus, the three-toed rhinoceros, the two-toed camel, sheep,
swine, deer, antelope, giraffe, and ox, and the one-toed horse and
zebra.</p>
<p>The carnivorous branch of the placental animals came from the
carnivorous branch of the marsupials. From early forms of
carnivorous placentals developed the ape-like lemurs and those
generalised forms of rapacious animals from which arose the
insect-eaters, the bats, and the true carnivora. The seals
represent a by-development from the main line of the carnivora, a
third defection, and a comparatively recent one, from land faunas.
Seals live at the meeting of the land and the waters rather than in
or on the waters, as do the cetaceans and sirenians. They have
retained their fur and their four limbs, but have almost lost their
power of land locomotion by the conversion of their feet into
flippers. The two front-limbs of seals are the only ones used as
ordinary limbs are used. The hind-limbs in most seals stretch
permanently out behind, the webbed digits spreading out fan-shaped
on either side of the stumpy tail, and constituting a rowing
apparatus functionally homologous with the tail of fishes and
whales. According to Jordan, the fur seals and the hair seals are
descended from different families of land carnivora, the former
probably from the bears, and the latter from the cats.</p>
<p>The lemurs are of especial interest to human beings, because in
them are found the first startling approximation in looks and
structure to the ‘human form divine.’ The lemurs are monkey-like
creatures living in trees, but differ enough from true monkeys to
be often placed in an order by themselves. Their milk glands are
abdominal instead of pectoral, as in the monkeys, and the second
digit of each hand and foot ends in a claw. The most of them live
in Madagascar. They are generally nocturnal in their habits,
although some species are diurnal. They appear first in the Eocene
rocks, and Haeckel thinks they may have developed from opossum-like
marsupials in the late Cretaceous or early Eocene Age.</p>
<p>From lemurs or from some other similar sort of semi-apes
developed the true apes—the flat-nosed (platyrhine) apes of the New
World and the narrow-nosed (catarhine) apes of the Old World. There
is considerable difference between the New World apes and those of
the Old World. The differences between the two classes is, in fact,
so striking that they are thought by some to have developed
independently of each other from distinct species of semi-apes. The
apes of the New World have flat noses, and the nostrils are far
apart and open in front of the nose, never below. The Old World
apes have narrow noses, the nostrils being close together and
opening downwards as in man. The tail of (nearly) all New World
apes is prehensile, being used regularly as a fifth limb, while
among Old World apes the tail is never so used. The Old World apes
all have the same number and kinds of teeth as man has, while the
New World apes (excepting the Brazilian marmosets) have an
additional premolar in each half-jaw, making thirty-six in all. The
catarhine apes are, therefore, structurally much nearer to man than
their platyrhine cousins. All tailed apes probably sprang
originally from a single stirp of semi-apes, and spread over the
earth at a time when the eastern and western land masses of the
southern hemisphere were connected with each other. The earliest
remains of apes appear in the Miocene Age.</p>
<p>From the Old World tailed apes were developed the tailless,
man-like, or anthropoid apes—the gorillas and chimpanzees of
Africa, and the orangs and gibbons of Asia and the East Indies. The
anthropoids arose from the tailed apes by the loss of the tail, the
thinning of the hairy covering, the enlargement of the fore-brain,
and by structural adaptations to a more nearly vertical position.
No remains of anthropoids are found earlier than the Pliocene
Age.</p>
<p>The man-like apes are the nearest living relatives of the human
races. It is not probable that man has been derived directly from
any of the existing races of man-like apes. For no one of them in
all particulars of its structure stands closer to him than the
rest. The orang approaches closest to man in the formation of the
brain, the chimpanzee in the shape of the spine and in certain
characteristics of the skull, the gorilla in the development of the
feet and in size, and the gibbon in the formation of the throat and
teeth. The earliest human races probably sprang from man-like races
of apes now extinct, who lived in southern Asia or in Africa during
the Pliocene Age (possibly as early as the Miocene), and who
combined in their structures the various man-like characters
possessed by existing anthropoids.</p>
<p>The earliest races of men were speechless—the ape-like
‘Alali’—beings, living wholly upon the ground and walking upon
their hind-limbs, but without more than the mere rudiments of
language. The vertical position led to a much greater development
of the posterior parts, especially of the muscles of the back and
the calves of the leg. The great toe, which in the ape is
opposable, lost its opposability, or all except traces of it, after
the abandonment of arboreal life. It must have been a sight fit to
stir the soul of the most leathern, these children of the night,
with low brows, stooping gait, and ape-like faces, armed with rude
clubs, clothed in natural hair, and wandering about in droves
without law, fire, or understanding, hiding in thickets and in the
holes of the earth, feeding on roots and fruits, and contending
doubtfully with the species around them for food and existence.</p>
<p>From the ‘Alali’—the speechless ape-men—we may imagine the true
men to have evolved—talking men, men with erect posture and mature
brain and larynx, the woolly-haired ulotrichi and the
straight-haired lissotrichi. There are four existing species of
woolly-haired men: the Papuans of New Guinea and Melanesia, and the
Hottentots, Caffres, and Negroes of southern, equatorial, and north
central Africa respectively. They all have long heads, slanting
teeth, very dark skin, and black, bushy hair, each individual hair
in cross-section being flat or oval in shape. In the
straight-haired races the skin is much fairer than in the
woolly-haired races, being seldom darker than brown, and each
individual hair in cross-section is round like the cross-section of
a cylinder. The principal species of straight-haired men are the
sea-roving Malays of the East Indies and the Pacific, the
round-faced Mongols of eastern and northern Asia, the aboriginal
Americans of the western hemisphere, and the incomparable Aryans,
including the ancient Greeks and Romans and the modern peoples of
India, Persia, and Europe.</p>
<p>Man is to-day the pre-eminent animal of the planet. The
successive ascendancies of the Worm, the Mollusk, the Crustacean,
the Fish, the Reptile, and the Mammal, are followed triumphantly by
the ascendancy of the Children of the Ape.</p>
<p>A large part of the life of the earth has remained steadfastly
where it was cradled, beneath the waves. But more restless portions
have left the sea and crept forth upon the land, or swarmed into
the air. One migration, the most numerous, is represented by the
insects. Another, the most enterprising, was the amphibian. After
ages of evolution the amphibian branch divided. One branch acquired
wings and sailed off into the air. The other divided and
subdivided. One of these subdivisions entered the forests, climbed
and clambered among the trees, acquired perpendicularity and hands,
descended and walked upon the soil, invented agriculture, built
cities and states, and imagined itself immortal. Human society is
but the van—the hither terminus—of an evolutional process which had
its beginning away back in the protoplasm of primeval waters. There
is not a form that creeps beneath the sea but can claim kinship
with the eagle. The philosopher is the remote posterity of the meek
and lowly amoeba.</p>

<h3 id="part1-chapter11">XI. Conclusion.</h3>
<p>The resemblances, homologies, and metamorphoses existing
everywhere among animal forms are, therefore, evidence of the most
logical consanguinities. It is all so perfectly plain. The
structures of organic beings have come about as a result of the
action and reaction of environment upon these structures. Every
being—and not only every being, but every species, the whole
organic world—has come to be what it is as a result of the
incessant hammerings of its surroundings, the hammerings not only
of the present, but of the long-stretching past. By surroundings is
meant, of course, the rest of the universe. Those animals belonging
to the same stock resemble each other because they have been
subjected to the same experiences, the same series of selections.
They have lain on the same great anvil, and felt the down-comings
of the same sledge. The similarities among animal forms in general
indicate relationships, just as the similarities among the races of
men indicate racial consanguinities. All men belong to the human
species because they are all fundamentally alike. But there are
differences in the character of the hair, in the colour of the
skin, in the conformation of the skull, and in the structure of the
language, among the different varieties of the species, indicating
striking variety in relationship and origin. An eminent biologist
has said that if Negroes and Caucasians were snails they would be
classed as entirely distinct species of animals. Whether, as is
thought by some, the woolly-haired races are the descendants of the
African anthropoids, and the straight-haired varieties are the
posterity of the orangs and gibbons, we may never know positively.
But we do know that these two great branches of mankind must have
different genealogies, extending to a remote antiquity, and that
the varieties belonging to each great group sustain to each other
the relations of a common kinship. Englishmen look like each other,
act like each other, and speak the same language. So do Frenchmen
and Swedes and Chinese. Every people is peculiar. This is not the
result of accident or agreement, but the result of law. Mongolians
do not all have short heads, yellow faces, slanting eyes, and
prominent malars because they have agreed to have them, but as a
result of a common pedigree. Similarity of structure implies
commonalty of origin, and commonalty of origin means
consanguinity.</p>
<p>And this is true whether you contemplate the featural
resemblances of brothers and sisters of the same human parent, or
those more fundamental characteristics which distinguish species,
orders, and sub-kingdoms. All animals are composed of protoplasm,
which is a compound of clay, because all animals are descended from
the same first parents, protoplasmic organisms evolved out of the
elemental ooze. All vertebrates have nerve-filled backbones with
two pairs of ventrally branching limbs, because the original
ancestors of the vertebrates had nerve-filled backbones with two
pairs of ventrally branching limbs. Insects individually evolve
from worms because worms are their phylogenetic fathers and
mothers. Man has hands and a vertical spine, and walks on his
hind-limbs, not because he was fashioned in the image of a god, but
because his ancestors lived among the trees. The habit of using the
posterior limbs for locomotion, and the anterior for prehension,
and the resulting perpendicular, are peculiarities developed by our
simian ancestors wholly on account of the incentives to such
structure and posture afforded by aboreal life. These peculiarities
would not likely have been acquired by quadrupeds living upon and
taking their food from a perfectly level and treeless plain. If
there had been no forests on the earth, therefore, there would have
been no incentive to the perpendicular, and the ‘human form divine’
would have been inconceivably different from what it is to-day. And
if fishes had had three serial pairs of limbs instead of two, and
their posterity had inherited them, as they certainly would have
had the foresight to do if they had had the opportunity, the
highest animals on the earth to-day, the ‘paragons of creation,’
would probably be two-handed quadrupeds (centaurs) instead of
two-handed bipeds. And much more efficient and ideal individuals
they would have been in every way than the rickety, peculiar,
unsubstantial plantigrades who, by their talent to talk, have
become the masters of the universe, and, by their imaginations,
‘divine.’</p>
<p>Kinship is universal. The orders, families, species, and races
of the animal kingdom are the branches of a gigantic arbour. Every
individual is a cell, every species is a tissue, and every order is
an organ in the great surging, suffering, palpitating process. Man
is simply one portion of the immense enterprise. He is as veritably
an animal as the insect that drinks its little fill from his veins,
the ox he goads, or the wild-fox that flees before his bellowings.
Man is not a god, nor in any imminent danger of becoming one. He is
not a celestial star-babe dropped down among mundane matters for a
time and endowed with wing possibilities and the anatomy of a
deity. He is a mammal of the order of primates, not so lamentable
when we think of the hyena and the serpent, but an exceedingly
discouraging vertebrate compared with what he ought to be. He has
come up from the worm and the quadruped. His relatives dwell on the
prairies and in the fields, forests, and waves. He shares the
honours and partakes of the infirmities of all his kindred. He
walks on his hind-limbs like the ape; he eats herbage and suckles
his young like the ox; he slays his fellows and fills himself with
their blood like the crocodile and the tiger; he grows old and
dies, and turns to banqueting worms, like all that come from the
elemental loins. He cannot exceed the winds like the hound, nor
dissolve his image in the mid-day blue like the eagle. He has not
the courage of the gorilla, the magnificence of the steed, nor the
plaintive innocence of the ring-dove. Poor, pitiful, glory-hunting
hideful! Born into a universe which he creates when he comes into
it, and clinging, like all his kindred, to a clod that knows him
not, he drives on in the preposterous storm of the atoms, as
helpless to fashion his fate as the sleet that pelts him, and lost
absolutely in the somnambulism of his own being.</p>

<h2>The Psychical Kinship</h2>
<h3 id="part2-chapter1">I. The Conflict of Science and
Tradition.</h3>
<p>The doctrine that on mankind’s account all other beings came
into existence, and that non-human beings are mere hunks of matter
devoid of all psychic qualities found in man, is a doctrine about
as sagacious as the old geocentric theory of the universe. Conceit
is a distinctly human emotion. No other animal has it. But it has
been lavished upon man with a generosity sufficient to compensate
for its total absence from the rest of the universe. Man has always
overestimated himself. In whatever age or province of the world you
look down on the human imagination, you find it industriously
digging disparities and establishing gulfs. Man, according to
himself, has had great difficulty many times in the history of the
world in escaping the divine. According to the facts, he has only
in recent biological times and after great labour and uncertainty
abandoned his tail and his all-fours. According to himself, man was
made ‘in the image of his maker,’ and has been endowed with powers
and properties peculiarly his own. According to the facts, he has
come into the world in a manner identical with that of all other
animals, and has been endowed with like nature and destiny. Man has
never manifested a warmer or more indelicate enthusiasm than the
enthusiasm with which he has appreciated himself. And with the same
ardour with which he has praised himself he has maligned and
misrepresented others. Man has set himself up as the supreme judge
and executive of the world, and he has not hesitated to award to
himself the lion’s share of everything. He has ransacked his fancy
for adjectives with which to praise himself, and driven his
inventive faculties to the verge of distraction in search of
justification for his crimes upon those around him. Every
individual bent on deeds of darkness first seeks in his own mind
justification for his purposed sins. And it is a caustic comment on
the character of human conviction that no enthusiastic
criminal—from the marauder of continents to the kitchen
pilferer—ever yet sought unsuccessfully at the court of his
conscience for a sinful permit. It was an easy matter, therefore,
for man—aided as he was by such an experienced imagination—to
convince himself that all other animals were made for him, that
they were made without feeling or intelligence, and that hence he
was justified in using in any way he chose the conveniences so
generously provided by an eccentric providence. But Darwin has
lived. Beings have come into the world, we now know, through the
operation of natural law. Man is not different from the rest. The
story of Eden is a fabrication, bequeathed to us by our
well-meaning but dimly-lighted ancestors. There has been no more
miracle in the origin of the human species than in the origin of
any other species. And there is no more miracle in the origin of a
species than there is in the birth of a molecule or in the breaking
of a tired wave on the beach. Man was not made in the image of the
hypothetical creator of heaven and earth, but in the image of the
ape. Man is not a fallen god, but a promoted reptile. The beings
around him are not conveniences, but cousins. Instead of stretching
away to the stars, man’s pedigree slinks down into the sea.
Horrible revelation! Frightful antithesis! Instead of celestial
genesis and a ‘fall’—long and doleful promotion. Instead of elysian
gardens and romance—the slime. Instead of a god with royal nostrils
miraculously animating an immortal duplicate—a little lounging
cellule, too small to be seen and too senseless to distinguish
between midnight and noon. But the situation is not half so
horrible as it looks to be to those who see only the skin of
things. Is it not better, after all, to be the honourable outcome
of a straightforward evolution than the offspring of flunky-loving
celestials? Are the illustrious children of the ape less glorious
than the sycophants of irrational theological systems? Darwin dealt
in his quiet way some malicious blows to human conceit, but he also
bequeathed to a misguided world the elements of its ultimate
redemption.</p>
<p>The supposed psychical gulf between human and non-human beings
has no more existence, outside the flamboyant imagination of man,
than has the once-supposed physical gulf. It is pure fiction. The
supposition is a relic of the rapidly dwindling vanity of
anthropocentricism, and is perpetuated from age to age by human
selfishness and conceit. It has no foundation either in science or
in common-sense. Man strives to lessen his guilt by the laudation
of himself and the disparagement and degradation of his victims.
Like the ostrich, who, pursued by death, improvises an imaginary
escape by plunging its head into the desert, so man, pursued by the
vengeful correctives of his own conscience, fabricates a fictitious
innocence by the calumniation of those upon whom he battens. But
such excuses cannot much longer hold out against the rising
consciousness of kinship. Psychology, like all other sciences, is
rapidly ceasing to attend exclusively to human phenomena. It is
lifting up its eyes and looking about; it is preparing to become
comparative. It has come to realise that the mind of man is but a
single shoot of a something which ramifies the entire animal world,
and that in order to understand its subject it is necessary for it
to familiarise itself with the whole field of phenomenon. The soul
of man did not commence to be in the savage. It commenced to be in
the worm, whose life man grinds out with his heel, and in the
bivalve that flounders in his broth. The roots of consciousness are
in the sea. Side by side with physical evolution has gone on
psychical evolution; side by side with the evolution of organs and
tissues has gone on the evolution of intellect, sensibility, and
will. Human nature and human mind are no more <em>sui generis</em>
than are human anatomy and physiology. The same considerations that
prove that man’s material organism is the cumulative result of long
evolution proclaim that human mind, the immaterial concomitant of
the material organism, is also the cumulative result of long
evolution.</p>
<p>We might just as well recognise facts first as last, for they
will have to be recognised some time. Truths are not put down by
inhospitality—they are simply put off. The universe has a policy, a
program. We may close our eyes to the facts around us, hoping in
this way to compel them to pass away or be forgotten. But they do
not pass away, nor will they be forgotten. They simply become
invisible. They will live on and present themselves to other minds
or ages or climes more hospitable or honest than our own. The only
proper attitude of mind to assume toward the various doctrines
existing among men is the attitude of perfect willingness to
believe <em>anything</em>—anything that appeals to us as being
reasonable and right. The great majority of men, however, are
intellectual solids—unable to move and unwilling to think. They
have certain beliefs <em>to which they are determined to hold
on</em>, and everything that does not fit in with these beliefs is
rejected as a matter of course.</p>
<h3 id="part2-chapter2">II. Evidences of Psychical Evolution.</h3>
<p>That mind has evolved, and that there is a psychical kinship, an
actual consanguinity of feelings and ideas, among all the forms of
animal life is proved incontestably by the following facts:</p>
<p>1. The evolution of mind is implied by the fact of the evolution
of structures. ‘I hold,’ says Romanes, in the introduction to his
great work on ‘Mental Evolution,’ ‘that, if the doctrine of organic
evolution is accepted, it carries with it, as a necessary
corollary, the doctrine of mental evolution.’ It makes no
difference what theory we adopt regarding the essential natures of
the physical and the psychical—whether we agree with the
materialist that mind is an attribute of matter, with the idealist
that matter is a creation of mind, with the monist that mind and
body are only different aspects of the same central entity, or with
the dualist that body and soul are two distinct but temporarily
dependent existences—we must in any case recognise the fact, which
is perceived by all, that there is an ever-faithful parallel
between the neural and psychical phenomena of every organism. And
if the elements which enter into and make up the physical structure
of man have been derived from, and determined by, preceding forms
of life, the elements which enter into and make up the psychical
counterpart of the physical have also, without any doubt, been
inherited from, and determined by, ancestral life forms.</p>
<p>2. Closely allied to the foregoing reason for a belief in the
evolution of mind is that derived from a comparative survey of the
nervous system in man and other animals. In man, mind is closely
associated with a certain tissue or system of tissues—<em>nerve
tissue or the nervous system</em>. That mind is correlated with
nerve structure, and that mental anatomy may be learned from a
study of the anatomy of the nervous system, especially of the
brain, is the basic postulate of the science of physiological
psychology. Now, nerve cells exist in all animals above the sponge,
and a comparatively well-developed nervous system is found even
among many of the invertebrates, as the higher worms, crustaceans,
insects, and mollusks. The nervous system of invertebrates, though
composed of the same kind of tissue, is constructed according to a
somewhat different plan of architecture from that of the
vertebrates. But in all of the great family of backboned animals
the nervous system is built on the same general plan as in man,
with a cerebro-spinal trunk extending from the head along the back
and motory and sensory nerves ramifying to all parts of the body.
There is also a sympathetic nervous system in all animals down as
far as the insects. The brain, which is the most important part of
the nervous system, and which has been called the ‘organ of
consciousness,’ presents throughout the animal kingdom, from its
beginning in the worms to man, a graduated series of increasing
complication proceeding out of the same fundamental type. This is
especially true of the vertebrates. Fishes, amphibians, reptiles,
birds, and mammals, all have in their brains the same primary
parts, the same five fundamental divisions, as are found in the
brain of man. Hence, whatever may be thought about the mental
states of invertebrates, we have the right, in the case of the
vertebrate orders of life, to infer, from the general similarity of
their nervous system to our own, that they have a corresponding
similarity to ourselves in mental constitution and experience.</p>
<p>3. The evolution of mind is suggested by the existence in the
animal world of all grades of intelligence, from almost mindless
forms to forms even exceeding in some respects the mental
attainments of men. The jelly-fish and the philosopher are not
mental aliens. They are linked to each other by a continuous
gradation of intermediate intelligences. The existence of these
grades of mental development suggest psychical evolution and
kinship, just as the existence of like grades of structural
development suggest physical evolution.</p>
<p>4. In the mental life of animals the same factors of evolution
exist as those by means of which organic structures have been
brought into existence, and it is reasonable to suppose that the
operation of these factors have produced in the mental world
results analogous to those produced by the operation of the same
factors among organic structures.</p>
<p>Men and other animals <em>vary</em> in their natures and mental
faculties quite as much as they do in colour, size, and shape. It
is commonly supposed that the mental and temperamental variety
existing among individual men does not exist among individual
birds, quadrupeds, insects, etc. But a little observation or
reflection ought to be enough to convince anyone that such a
supposition belongs to that batch of pre-Darwinian mistakes
presented to us by an over-generous past. We are <em>not
acquainted</em> with the inhabitants of our fields and barn-yards.
We are almost as ignorant of the mental life and personality of
these door-yard neighbours and friends of ours as we would be if
they were the inhabitants of another continent. That is why our
obtuse minds lump them together so indiscriminately—we do not know
anything about them. We never take the trouble, or think it worth
while, to get acquainted with them, much less to study and know
them. We have grown up in the falsehood that they are altogether
different from what we are, and that it is really not worth while
to bother our gigantic heads about them, except to use them when it
comes handy, or kick them to one side, or execute them, when they
get in the way. Everybody else looks at the matter in about the
same way, so we just let it go at that.</p>
<p>There is a sameness about foreigners and other classes of
<em>human</em> beings with whom we are but slightly, or not at all,
acquainted, until we come to know them and can discriminate one
from another. I remember once asking my sister, if her baby, which
looked to me like all other babies I had ever seen, were mixed up
with a lot of other babies of about the same age, whether she could
pick hers out from all the rest, and she gave me an unmistakable
affirmative by answering, ‘What a foolish question!’</p>
<p>There is less variety among the individuals of non-human races
than among individual men, just as there is less variety among
individual savages than among the members of a civilised community.
But there is mental diversity among all beings, and we only need to
whittle our observation a little to recognise the fact. You never
hear the keeper of a menagerie or any intelligent associate of
dogs, horses, birds, or insects say there is no individuality among
these animals. Brehm, the great German naturalist, assures us that
each individual monkey of all those he kept tame in Africa had its
own peculiar temper and disposition. And this is no more than what
everyone who knows anything about it knows to be true of dogs,
horses, cats, cattle, birds, and even fishes and insects. Any
intelligent dog-fancier or pigeon-fancier can tell you the personal
peculiarities of every one of the fifty or a hundred dogs or
pigeons in his charge. He has watched and studied them since they
came into existence, and through this continuous association he has
come to <em>know</em> them. He simply makes discriminations that
are not made by the casual or superficial observer. The Laplander
knows and names each reindeer in his herd, though to a stranger
they are all as much alike as the multitudes on an ant-hill. The
Peckhams of Milwaukee, those indefatigable investigators of spiders
and insects, are constantly telling us of the wonderful
individuality possessed by these lowly lessees of our fields and
gardens. In their work on ‘The Habits and Instincts of the Solitary
Wasps,’ speaking of the ammophiles, these authors say: ‘In this
species, as in every one that we have studied, we have found a most
interesting variation among the different individuals, not only in
methods, but in character and intellect. While one was beguiled
from her hunting by every sorrel blossom she passed, another stuck
to her work with indefatigable perseverance. While one stung her
caterpillars so carelessly and made her nest in so shiftless a way
that her young could survive only through some lucky chance,
another devoted herself to these duties not only with conscientious
earnestness, but with an apparent craving after artistic perfection
that was touching to see.’ The variation in the mental phenomena of
animals, including man, is partly innate, and partly the result of
environment or education.</p>
<p>Animals not only vary in their mental qualities, but they also
<em>inherit</em> these variations, just as they do physical
properties and peculiarities. Evidence of this is furnished by
every new being that comes into the world. Insanity runs in
families, and so does genius and criminality. Even the most
trifling idiosyncrasies are often transmitted, not only by men, but
also by dogs, horses, and other animals. Such qualities of mind as
courage, fidelity, good and bad temper, intelligence, timidity,
special tastes and aptitudes, are certainly transmitted in all the
higher orders of animal life.</p>
<p>Animals are also <em>selected</em>, are enabled to survive in
the struggle for life quite as much through the possession by them
of certain mental qualities as on account of their physical
characters. Whether the selections are made by nature or by man,
they are not determined by the physical facts of size, strength,
speed, and the like, more than by cunning, courage, sagacity,
skill, industry, devotion, ferocity, tractability, and other mental
properties. The fittest survive, and the fittest may be the most
timid or analytic as well as the most powerful. No better
illustration of this truth can be found than that furnished by man
himself. Man is by nature a comparatively feeble animal. He is
neither large nor powerful. Yet he has been selected to prosper
over all other animals because of his ingenuity, sympathy, and art.
The great feeling and civilisation of higher men have been built up
by slow accretion due to the operation of the law of survival
extending over vast measures of time. Creeds and instincts,
governments and impulses, forms of thought and forms of expression,
have struggled and survived just as have cells and species. A
struggle for existence is constantly going on, as Max Müller has
pointed out, even among the words and grammatical forms of every
language. The better, shorter, easier forms are constantly gaining
the ascendancy, and the longer and more cumbrous expressions grow
obsolete.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the higher types of mind have not come into
existence as have the higher types of structure, through evolution
from simpler and more generalised forms, it has not been due to the
absence of the factors necessary for bringing about this
evolution.</p>
<p>5. The presumption created by the existence of the factors of
psychic evolution is strengthened by the facts of artificial
selection. We <em>know</em> mind <em>can</em> evolve, <em>for it
has done so in many cases</em>. The races of domesticated animals,
the races whom man has exploited and preyed upon during the past
several thousand years, have, many of them, been completely changed
in character and intelligence through human selection. Old
instincts have been wiped out and new ones implanted. In many
instances the psychology has been not only revolutionised, but
remade.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the dog. The dog is a reformed bandit. It is
a revised wolf or jackal. It has been completely transformed by
human selection; indeed, it may be said that the dog in the last
ten or fifteen thousand years has made greater advances in sagacity
and civilisation than any other animal, scarcely even excepting
man. Man has made wonderful strides along purely intellectual
lines, but in the improvement of his emotions he has not been so
successful. The rapid development of the dog in feeling and
intelligence has no doubt been due to the fact that his utility to
man has always depended largely on his good sense and fidelity, and
man has persistently emphasised these qualities in his selection.
Fierceness and distrust—two of the most prominent traits in the
psychology of the primitive dog—have been entirely eradicated in
the higher races of dogs. There is not anywhere on the face of the
earth a more trustful, affectionate, and docile being than this
one-time cut-throat. Whether the dog has been derived from the wolf
or from some wild canine race now extinct, or from several distinct
ancestors, he must have had originally a fierce, distrustful, and
barbaric nature, for all of the undomesticated members of the dog
family wolves, foxes, jackals, etc.—have natures of this sort.</p>
<p>There are about 175 different races of domestic dogs. They
represent almost as great a range of development as do the races of
men. Some of them are exceedingly primitive, while others are
highly intelligent and civilised. The Eskimo dogs are really
nothing but wolves that have been trained to the service of man.
They look like wolves, and have the wolf psychology. They are not
able to bark, like ordinary dogs; they howl like wolves, and their
ears stand up straight, like the ears of all wild Canidae. Some of
the more advanced of the canine races—like the sheep-dogs,
pointers, and St. Bernards—are animals of great sympathy and
sensibility. When educated, these dogs are almost human in their
impulses and in their powers of discernment. In patience,
vigilance, and devotion to duty, they are superior to many men. At
a word, or even a look, from its master, the loyal collie will
gather the sheep scattered for miles around to the place
designated, and do it with such tact and expedition as to command
admiration. It has been said that if it were not for this faithful
and competent canine the highlands of Scotland would be almost
useless for sheep-raising purposes, because of the greater expense
that would be entailed if men were employed. One collie will do the
work of several men, and will do it better, and the
generous-hearted creature pours out its services like water. It
requires no compensation except table refuse and a straw bed. In
South America sheep-dogs are trained to act as shepherds and assume
the whole responsibility of tending the flock. ‘It is a common
thing,’ says Darwin, ‘to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one
or two dogs, at a distance of some miles from any house or man.’
When the dogs get hungry, they come home for food, but immediately
return to the flock on being fed. ‘It is amusing,’ remarks this
writer, ‘to observe, when approaching a flock, how the dog
immediately advances barking, while the sheep all close in his rear
as around the oldest ram.’ Romanes relates an incident which well
illustrates the high character and intelligence of the dog and its
wonderful devotion to a trust. ‘It was a Scotch collie. Her master
was in the habit of consigning sheep to her charge without
supervision. On this particular occasion he remained behind or
proceeded by another road. On arriving at home late in the evening,
he was astonished to learn that his faithful animal had not made
her appearance with the drove. He immediately set out in search of
her. But on going out into the streets, there she was coming with
the drove, not one missing, and, marvellous to relate, she was
carrying a young puppy in her mouth. She had been taken in travail
on the hills, and how the poor creature had contrived to manage her
drove in her condition is beyond human calculation, for her road
lay through sheep all the way. Her master’s heart smote him when he
saw what she had suffered and effected. But she was nothing
daunted, and after depositing her young one in a place of safety
she again set out full speed for the hills, and brought another and
another, till she brought the whole litter, one by one; but the
last one was dead’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter2-footnote1"

"part2-chapter2-ref1a">[1a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>What a wonderful transformation in canine character! The very
beings whose blood the dog once drank with ravenous thirst it now
protects with courage and fidelity. And this transformation in
character is not due to education simply. It is innate. Young dogs
brought from Tierra del Fuego or Australia, where the natives do
not keep such domestic animals as sheep, pigs, and poultry,
invariably have an incurable propensity for attacking these
animals.</p>
<p>The feeling of ownership possessed by so many dogs is an
entirely new element in canine character, a trait implanted wholly
by human selection. Bold and confident on his own premises, the dog
immediately becomes weak and apologetic when placed in
circumstances in which he feels he has no rights.</p>
<p>The pointers and setters have been developed as distinct breeds
by human selection during the past 150 or 200 years.</p>
<p>What is true of the dog is true also, to a large extent, of the
cat, cow, horse, sheep, goat, fowl, and other domestic animals.
Serene and peaceful puss is the tranquillised descendant of the
wild cat of Egypt, one of the most untamable of all animals. The
migratory instinct, so strong in wild water-fowl, is almost absent
from our geese and ducks, as is the fighting propensity (prominent
in the Indian jungle-bird) from most varieties of the domesticated
chicken. There are now as many as a hundred different kinds of
domesticated animals, and there is scarcely one of these animals
that has not been profoundly changed in character during the period
of its domestication. There are much greater changes in some races
than in others. Some races have been much longer in captivity than
others. And then, too, there is great difference in the degree of
plasticity in different races, the races of ancient origin being
much more fixed in their psychology than those of more recent
beginnings. In some races, too—as in the sheep—the selections made
by man have been made primarily with reference to certain physical
qualities, and in these cases the mental qualities have been only
incidentally affected. In Polynesia, where it is selected for its
flavour instead of for its fleetness or intelligence, the dog is
said to be a very stupid animal. But in most cases of domestication
the changes wrought by selection in the mental make-up of the race
have been fully as great as the changes in body, and in some
instances much greater. And the process by which these great
changes in psychology have been effected is in principle
identically the same as that by which mental evolution in general
is assumed to have been brought about.</p>
<p>History everywhere has come out of the night, out of the deep
gloom of the unrecorded. But it has not leaped forth like lightning
out of the darkness. It has dawned, night being succeeded by the
amorphous shadows of legend and tradition, and these in turn by the
attested events of true history. Almost every civilised people can
trace back its genealogy to a time when it was represented on the
earth by one or more tribes of savage or half-savage ancestors. The
Anglo-Saxons go back to the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, three
semi-savage tribes who came to England from the borderlands of the
Baltic fourteen or fifteen centuries ago. The French are the
descendants of the Gauls, who formed the scattered population of
warring and superstitious tribes referred to by Julius Caesar in
the opening lines of his ‘Commentaries.’ The blue-eyed Germans came
from the Cimbri, the Goths, and the Vandals, those bold, wild
hordes who charged out of the north to battle with the power of
Rome. And all of the Aryan races—English, German, Italian,
Scandinavian, Russian, Roman, Greek, and Persian—trace their
ancestry back, by means of common languages and legends, to a time
when they were wandering tribes of nomads tenting somewhere on the
plains of transcaspian Asia.</p>
<p>6. The evolution of mind in the animal world in general is
suggested by the fact that mind in man has evolved. The rich,
luminous intellect of civilised man, with its art, science, law,
literature, government, and morality, has been evolved from the
rude, raw, demon-haunted mind of the savage. Evidence of this
evolution is furnished by the recorded facts of human history, by
the antiquarian collections of our museums, and by a study of
existing savages.</p>
<p>In all our museums there are collections of the relics of
prehistoric peoples. These collections consist of objects upon
which men in distant ages of the world have wrought—their weapons,
ornaments, utensils, implements, and playthings—which have been
saved from the teeth of Time by their durability. The character of
the minds which operated on these objects, which produced and used
them, may be inferred from the character of the objects, just as
the life and surroundings of an ancient animal or plant may be
inferred from its fossil. These relics are of stone, bone, bronze,
and iron. They are found in almost every region of the earth—all
over Europe and its islands, in western and central Asia, in China
and Japan, in Malay, Australia, and New Zealand, in the islands of
the Pacific, and throughout the length and breadth of America. They
antedate human history by thousands of years. They are the ruins of
the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age of mankind. In all
of these remains there is evidence of a slow but gradual
improvement as we approach the present. There are places on the
earth where the evolution of human implements, from the rudest
chipped stones to the comparatively finished products of historic
peoples, is epitomised in the deposits of a few feet in depth. One
of these occurs at Chelles, a suburb of Paris, and was made the
subject of a paper by Professor Packard in the <em>Popular Science
Monthly</em> for May, 1902. Here three distinct layers, containing
human remains entirely different in character from each other,
appear within a depth of 30 feet from the surface. The lowest bed,
a layer of pebbles and sand, and probably preglacial in origin,
contains the famous Chellean ‘axes,’ rude almond-shaped implements
of chipped flint, and used by these ancient inhabitants by being
held in the hand. In this bed are also found the bones of the
straight-tusked elephant, cave-bear, big-nosed rhinoceros, and
other species now extinct. The next bed is the interglacial, and
contains implements entirely different from the one below it, among
which are skin-scrapers and lance-points. The animal remains of
this bed are also different from those found in the bed below, and
include animals like the musk-ox and the reindeer, which were
probably driven to this southern clime from more northern regions
by the excessive cold of the time. The third bed, which lies just
below the surface soils, contains polished stone axes and other
remains of human industry cotemporaneous with the Swiss
lake-dwellers. From the swamps and loams are sometimes dug up the
remains of Gallo-Roman civilisations—Gallic coins, serpentine axes,
and bronzes of the time of the Antonines.</p>
<p>No one can fully realise the vast advance that has been made by
the human mind until he has looked upon a savage—has seen the
savage in his native haunts attacking the problems of his daily
life, and has tasted of his philosophy and disposition. The savage
is the ancestor of all higher men. When we look upon the savage, we
look upon the infancy of the human world. All of the laws,
languages, sciences, governments, religions, and philosophies of
civilised man, or nearly all of them at any rate, are the
exfoliated laws, languages, sciences, governments, religions, and
philosophies of savages. It is impossible to understand the laws of
civilised societies without a knowledge of the laws of savage
societies. The same thing is true of government, religion, and
philosophy—and of human nature itself. Human nature as exhibited by
civilised men and women—I mean men and women with a veneering of
civility, not really civilised folks, for there are none of them on
the earth—is a perpetual enigma unless it is illumined by
retrospection, by a comparative study of human nature, by a study
of human nature as seen in more and more primitive men and women.
The mind of the savage, as compared with that of civilised man, is
exceedingly primitive. The picture drawn by Gilbraith of the North
American Sioux is a typical picture of savage life and character.
Gilbraith lived among these tribes for several years, and was
thoroughly acquainted with them. He says:</p>
<p>‘They are bigoted, barbarous, and exceedingly superstitious.
They regard most of the vices as virtues. Theft, arson, rape, and
murder are regarded by them as the means of distinction. The young
Indian is taught from childhood to regard killing as the highest of
virtues. In their dances and at their feasts, the warriors recite
their deeds of theft, pillage, and slaughter as precious things;
and the highest, indeed the only, ambition of the young brave is to
secure “the feather,” which is but the record of his having
murdered, or participated in the murder of, some human
being—whether man, woman, or child, it is
immaterial’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter2-footnote2" id=
"part2-chapter2-ref2" name=

<p>‘Conscience,’ says Burton, ‘does not exist in East Africa, and
“repentance” simply expresses regret for missed opportunities for
crime. Robbery makes an honorable man; and murder, the more
atrocious the crime the better, makes the hero’.‘Conscience,’ says
Burton, ‘does not exist in East Africa, and “repentance” simply
expresses regret for missed opportunities for crime. Robbery makes
an honorable man; and murder, the more atrocious the crime the
better, makes the hero’.<sup><small><a href=

<p>Many things appear natural and self-evident to the savage which
seem to us actually revolting. When the Fuegians are hard pressed
by want, they kill their old women for food rather than their dogs,
saying: ‘Old women no use; dogs kill otters.’ ‘What I’ said a negro
to Burton, ‘am I to starve while my sister has children whom she
can sell?’</p>
<p>Lubbock, in his great work on ‘The Origin of Civilisation,’
cites hundreds of instances of savage rudeness and simplicity which
seem almost incredible to one accustomed all his life to types of
human character such as are found in Europe and America. For
instance, ‘when the natives of the Lower Murray first saw
pack-oxen, some of them were frightened and took them for demons
with spears on their heads, while others thought they were the
wives of the settlers, because they carried the baggage.’ Speaking
of the wild men in the interior of Borneo, this writer says: ‘They
live absolutely in a state of nature, neither cultivating the
ground nor living in huts. They eat neither rice nor salt, and do
not associate with each other, but rove about the woods like wild
beasts. The sexes meet in the jungle. When the children are old
enough to shift for themselves, they usually separate, neither one
afterwards thinking of the other. At night they sleep under some
large tree whose branches hang low. They fasten the children to the
branches in a kind of swing, and build a fire around the tree to
protect them from snakes and wild beasts. The poor creatures are
looked on and treated by the other Dyaks as wild beasts.’ Lubbock
sums up his conclusions on the morality of savages in the following
pathetic acknowledgment: ‘I do not remember a single instance in
which a savage is recorded as having shown any symptoms of remorse;
and almost the only case I can call to mind in which a man
belonging to one of the lower races has accounted for an act by
saying explicitly that it was right, was when Mr. Hunt asked a
young Figian why he had killed his mother’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter2-footnote4" id="part2-chapter2-ref4a" name=
"part2-chapter2-ref4a">[4a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>A few pages further on, the same author adds, regarding the
deplorable state of morality among savages: ‘That there should be
races of men so deficient in moral feeling was altogether opposed
to the preconceived ideas with which I commenced the study of
savage life, and I have arrived at the conviction by slow degrees,
and even with reluctance. I have, however, been forced to this
conclusion, not only by the direct statements of travellers, but
also by the general tenor of their remarks, and especially by the
remarkable absence of repentance and remorse among the lowest races
of men.’ Among ourselves the words used to distinguish right and
wrong are metaphors. Right originally meant ‘straight,’ and wrong
meant ‘twisted.’ Language existed, therefore, before morality; for
if moral ideas had preceded language, there would have been
original words to stand for them. Religion, according to Lubbock,
has no moral aspect or influence except among the more advanced
races of men. ‘The deities of savages are evil, not good; they may
be forced into compliance with the wishes of man; they generally
delight in bloody, and often require human, sacrifices; they are
mortal, not immortal; they are to be approached by dances rather
than by prayers; and often approve what we call vice rather than
what we esteem as virtue. In fact, the so-called religion of the
lower races of mankind bears somewhat the same relation to religion
in its higher forms as astrology does to astronomy or alchemy to
chemistry’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter2-footnote4" id=
"part2-chapter2-ref4b" name=

<p>Savages have few general ideas of any kind, as is evidenced by
the almost total absence among them of words denoting general
ideas. Many savage races cannot comprehend numbers greater than
five or six, and are unable to make the simplest mathematical
computations without using the fingers. The languages of savages
are extremely rude, words being freely pieced out with pantomime.
Savages talk with difficulty in the dark, because of their great
reliance on gesture in conversation. The rich vocabularies of the
languages of Europe and America have grown up step by step with the
evolution of European and American mind. Every language is an
evolution. The languages of many primitive peoples lack the verb to
be entirely, and all nouns are proper nouns. Words are often little
more than grunts or clucks, and are without the euphony and
articulation found in the languages of the civilised. Darwin says
that the language of the Fuegians sounds like a man clearing his
throat. Not only every language, but every word, both in its form
and meaning, is in process of evolution. <em>Spirit</em>, for
instance, originally meant ‘blowing,’ <em>understanding</em> meant
‘getting beneath,’ and <em>development</em> the physical act of
‘unfolding.’ Words are continually drifting from their original
meanings under the stress of incessant use, as ships drag their
anchors in a gale. Those words that are exposed to common use
undergo the most rapid changes, while words sheltered from the rush
of human affairs, like harboured ships, hold to their moorings
forever. <em>Let</em>, for instance, once meant ‘hinder’; now it
means ‘allow.’ <em>Bisect</em>, on the other hand, a word of rare
and technical use, has remained unaltered in significance for
twenty centuries.</p>
<p>Even our alphabet has been evolved. The twenty-six symbols
composing it have been eroded into the peculiar forms in which they
appear at present by the various peoples through whose hands they
have come to us. The originals were pictographs such as are still
found on the aged monuments of earth’s earliest civilisations. The
English got their alphabet from the Romans, who obtained it, along
with almost everything else they had, from the Greeks. The Greeks
received it from the Phenicians, and the Phenicians from the
papyrus writers of Egypt, who in turn procured it from those
hieroglyph chiselers who carved their curious literature on the
granite tombs of the Nile in the remotest dawn of human history.
<em>A</em>, the first letter of our alphabet, is a figure which has
been evolved, as the result of long wear and tear, from the picture
of an eagle; <em>B</em> was originally the picture of a crane;
<em>C</em> represents a throne; <em>D</em> a hand; <em>F</em> an
asp; <em>H</em> a sieve; <em>K</em> a bowl; <em>L</em> a lioness;
<em>M</em> an owl; <em>N</em> a water-line; <em>R</em> a mouth;
<em>S</em> a garden; <em>T</em> a lasso; <em>X</em> a chairback;
and <em>Z</em> a duck.</p>
<p>The psychology of civilised man, though derived from that of the
savage, and hence resembling it fundamentally, is, nevertheless,
very different from it, both in character and in what it contains.
The mind of the savage is rude, unresourceful, vicious, and
childlike, while that of the civilised man or woman may be
overflowing with wisdom and benignity. This gulf has not been
covered by a stride, but by the slow operation of the same laws of
Inheritance, Variation, and Selection by which all progress has
been brought about.</p>
<p>7. Degeneration is a necessary part of the process of organic
evolution. All progress, whether anatomical, intellectual, or
social, takes place through selection, and selection means the
pining and ultimate passing away of that which is left. In
individual evolution it is organs, ideas, and traits of character
that are eliminated, and in social evolution it is customs and
institutions. One of the reasons given in the preceding chapter for
the belief in the evolution of structures is the existence in man
and other animals of <em>vestigial organs</em>, organs which in
lower forms of life are useful, but which in higher forms are
represented by useless or even injurious remnants. Similar remnants
are found in the <em>psychology</em> of man and other animals.
These vestiges of mind are not so easily recognised as the vestiges
of structure, but they are everywhere. We find them in the
antiquated instincts of man and the domestic animals, in the silent
letters and worn-out words of languages, and in the emaciated
remains of abandoned beliefs and institutions.</p>
<p>The hunting and fishing instinct of civilised man is a vestigial
instinct, normal in the savage, but without either sense or decency
among men devoted to industrial pursuits. The savage hunts and
fishes because he is hungry, never for pastime; civilised men and
women do so because they are too mechanical to assort their
impulses. Civilised man is a mongrel, a cross between a barbarian
and a god. His psychology is a compound of the jungle and the sky.
In their loftier moments, many men are able to obscure the cruder
facts of their origin and to put into temporary operation those
more splendid processes of mind which characterise their ideals.
But even the most civilised are forever haunted by the returning
ghosts of departed propensities—propensities which grew up in ages
of hate, which are now out-of-date, but which in the trying tedium
of daily life come back and usurp the high places in human nature.
Revenge, hate, cruelty, pugnacity, selfishness, vanity, and the
like, are all more or less vestigial among men who have entered
seriously on the life of altruism. Like the vermiform appendix and
the human tail, these old obsolete parts of the human mind are
destined, in the ripening of the ages, to waste away and disappear
through disuse.</p>
<p>The practice of the dog of turning round two or three times
before lying down is in response to an instinct which was no doubt
beneficial to it in its wild life, when it was wont to make its bed
in the grasses, but which is now a pure waste of time. Darwin
records it as a fact, that he has himself seen a simple-minded dog
turn round twenty times before lying down. The sheep-killing mania,
which sometimes comes over dogs when three or four of them get
together and become actuated by the ‘mob’ spirit, is a vestige of
the old instinct of the carnivore which centuries of domestication
have not yet quite erased. Goodness, if too prolonged, becomes
irksome to dogs for the same reason that it does to men. Dogs have
come from savages just as men have, and, while the civilised nature
of the dog is more constitutional than that of civilised man, the
old deposed instincts mount to the throne once in awhile, and the
faithful collie is for the time being a wolf again. The instinct of
domestic sheep to imitate their leader in leaping over obstacles is
another probable survival of wild life. If a bar or other obstacle
be placed where the leader of a flock of sheep is compelled to leap
over it, and the obstacle is then removed, the entire band of
followers will leap at the same place regardless of the fact that
the obstruction is no longer there. No other animals do this. The
instinct is probably a survival of wild life, when these animals,
pursued by their enemies over chasms and precipices, were compelled
to imitate in the flight those in front of them in order to live.
Darwin thinks the donkey shows its aboriginal desert nature in its
aversion for crossing the smallest stream, and its relish for
rolling in the dust. The same aversion for everything aquatic
exists also in the camel. Quails kept in captivity, I am told,
persist in scratching at the pan when they are feeding, just as
they would need to do, and were accustomed to do, among the leaves
and grasses of the groves. The restlessness of cage-birds and
domestic fowls at migrating time, the mimic dipping and sporting of
ducks when confined to a terrestrial habitat, the grave marshalling
of geese by the chief gander of the band, the ferocity of cows,
ewes, and the females of other domestic animals during the first
few days of motherhood, the hunting instinct of dogs kept as
shepherds and pets, the squatting of young pigs when suddenly
alarmed—all of these are vestigial instincts, functional in the
wild state, but now useless and absurd.</p>
<p>The silent letters and superannuated words and phrases found
everywhere in literature are the vestigial parts of language. Every
silent letter was originally sounded, and every obsolete word was
at one time used. In the French word, <em>temps</em>, for instance,
which means ‘time,’ neither the <em>p</em> nor the <em>s</em> is
sounded. But in the Latin word <em>tempus</em>, from which the
French word is derived, all of the letters are sounded.</p>
<p>Man has been defined as a creature of habit. As he has done a
thing once, or as his ancestors have done a thing, so he does it
again. By precept and example he transmits to each new generation
the customs, beliefs, and points of view which he has invented.
Social changes take place with extreme moderation. The drowsy ages
take plenty of time to get anywhere. Civilisation is lazy,
deliberate, unimpassioned. It loafs and hesitates. It holds on to
the past. Living civilisations always drag behind them a trail of
traditions from dead civilisations. Religions and philosophies
change, and creeds and governments flow into strange and
undreamed-of forms; but their personalities survive, their souls
live on, their remnants, transmitted as traditions from generation
to generation, defy the meddlings of innovators. Hence in every
society there are forms and ceremonies, laws and customs, games and
symbols, etc., which have been completely diverted from their
original purposes, or which have become so reduced in importance as
to be of no use. Spencer has shown that the forms of salutation in
vogue among civilised societies are the vestiges of primitive
ceremonial used to denote submission. The May Day festivals with
which the opening spring is usually hailed are the much-modified
survivals of pagan festivals in honour of plant and animal
fecundity. Superstition and folklore are vestigial opinions. The
gorgeous Easter egg is a survival of a dawn myth older than the
Pyramids, and our Christmas dinner is a reminiscence of a cannibal
carnival celebrating the turning back of the sun at the winter
solstice (Brinton). In the English government, where democracy has
in recent centuries made such inroads on the monarchy, there are
numerous examples of vestigial institutions—institutions which
continue to exist purely because they have existed in the past, but
which were functional a few centuries ago. The supreme office
itself is one of these. The King represents the petered-out
tail-end of a privilege which in the time of the early Stuarts was
almost unlimited. Similar vestiges exist in the United States,
where the national spirit during the last century and a half has so
completely wiped out colonialism. Such are the Town Meetings of
Boston and of New Haven. The earliest form of human marriage was
marriage by capture. The man stole the woman and carried her away
by force. This form of marriage was in the course of evolution
succeeded by marriage through purchase. A man anxious to become a
husband could do so by paying to the father a stipulated amount of
cash or cattle for his daughter. This second form of marriage
finally evolved into marriage arranged by direct and peaceful
negotiation between the prospective husband and wife. This is the
form most commonly employed at the present time among the more
advanced societies of men. But in the ceremonies which surround the
nuptial event among civilised peoples survive vestiges of many of
the facts associated with aboriginal marriages. A marriage in high
life is a sort of epitome of the evolution of the institution. The
coyness and hesitancy of the woman in accepting the offers of her
proposed spouse are the lineal descendants of the original
reluctance of her savage sisters. The wedding-ring is the old token
accepted by the woman when she gave her pledge of bondage. The
coming of the groom with his aids to the marriage is a figurative
marauding expedition. The honeymoon is the abduction. And the
charivari and missile-throwing indulged in by friends and relatives
on the departure of the wedded twain is a good-humoured counterfeit
of the armed protest made by relatives of old when a bride-snatcher
came among them.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter2-footnote5" id=

<p>The vestiges found everywhere in the mental and social phenomena
of man and other animals have arisen as necessary facts in the
process of mental evolution. <em>They are the vermiform appendices
of the mind</em>.</p>
<p>8. One of the strongest reasons for a belief in the physical
evolution of animal species is that furnished by individual
evolution. Each individual animal recapitulates in a wonderful
manner the phylogenesis of its species. Now, it is extremely
significant that a similar parallel exists in the case of mental
evolution. Each individual mind ascends through a series of mental
faculties which epitomises in a remarkable manner the psychogenesis
of the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>The human child is not born with a full-grown mind any more than
with a full-grown body. It grows. It exfoliates. It ripens with the
years. It begins in infancy at the zero-point, and in manhood or
womanhood may blaze with genius and philanthropy.</p>
<p>But the mind of the child not only unfolds: it unfolds in a
certain order, the more complex parts and the more civilised
emotions invariably appearing last. The initial powers of the
newborn babe are those of sensation and perception. The babe cannot
think. It has no feeling of fear, no affection, no sympathy, and no
shame. It can see, and hear, and taste, and feel pain and
satisfaction—and these are about all. Even these are vague and
confused. In a week the perceptions are more sharp and vivid, more
distinct and orderly. Memory arises. Memory is the power of
reproducing past impressions. At three weeks the emotions begin to
sprout. The first to make their appearance are fear and surprise.
When the babe is seven weeks old the social affections show
themselves, and the simplest acts of association are performed. At
the age of twelve weeks jealousy and anger may be expected,
together with simple exhibitions of association by similarity. At
fourteen weeks affection and reason dawn. Sympathy germinates at
about the age of five months; pride and resentment germinate at
eight months; grief, hate, and benevolence at ten months; and shame
and remorse at fifteen months.</p>
<p>Now, the remarkable thing about this is that this is the order,
or very much like the order, in which mind in the animal kingdom as
a whole has apparently evolved. The lower orders of animal life
have none of the higher emotions and none of the more complicated
processes of mind. There is no shame in the reptile, no
dissimulation in the fish, no sympathy in the mollusk, and no
memory in the sponge. Memory dawns in the echinoderms, or somewhere
near the radiate stage of development, and fear and surprise in the
worms. Pugnacity makes its appearance in the insects, imagination
in the spiders, and jealousy in the fishes. Pride, emulation, and
resentment originate in the birds: grief and hate in the carnivora;
shame and remorse among dogs and monkeys; and superstition in the
savage.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter2-footnote1" id=
"part2-chapter2-ref1b" name=
"part2-chapter2-ref1b">[1b]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>It is also an important fact bearing on the general problem of
evolution, that the civilised child, from about the age of one on,
is a sort of synopsis, rude but unmistakable, of the historic
evolution of the human race. The child is a savage. It has the
emotions of the savage, the savage’s conceptions of the world, and
the desires, pastimes, and ambitions of the savage. It hates work,
and takes delight in hunting, fishing, fighting, and loafing, like
other savages. The hero of the child is the bully, just as the
demigod of primitive man is a blood-letting Caesar or Achilles. The
children of the civilised are savages—some more so than others—and
if they ever become civilised—some do, and some do not—they do so
through a process of rectification and selection similar to that
through which the Aryan races have passed during the ages of human
history.</p>
<p>There is a similar evolution in the young of other animals,
especially of the higher animals. Each individual begins in a
perfectly mindless form, and grows mentally as it develops
physically. The young puppy has a very different thinking and
feeling apparatus from the grown-up mastiff. It is controlled
almost exclusively by sense and instinct. It is devoid of
common-sense, and divides its time impartially between play and
sleep. It is easily frightened, and cries at every little thing. It
has the rollicking, awkward, irresponsible personality of a boy of
six. About the same thing is true of kittens, colts, calves, bear
cubs, the whelps of wolves, and other young quadrupeds. A kitten
will chase shadows, try to catch flies crawling on the other side
of a windowpane, sit and watch in wonder the moving objects about
it, and do many other things which it never thinks of doing when it
has grown to be a wise and sophisticated puss trained in the ways
of the world about it. Doghood, cathood, and horsehood, like
manhood and womanhood, are the ripened products of long processes
of growth and exfoliation.</p>
<p>The parallel is, of course, imperfect. There are many
abbreviations, many breaks and ambiguities, in the summary
presented by the individual mind of the evolution of the race. And,
in the present state of psychogeny, only the barest outline can be
traced. <em>But enough is known to render the fact
unquestionable</em>.</p>
<p>9. If human mind has been evolved, it is logical to expect to
find in other animals, especially in those more closely resembling
ourselves in structure, mind elements similar to those we find in
ourselves.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter2-footnote6" id=
"part2-chapter2-ref6" name=
"part2-chapter2-ref6">[6]</a></small></sup> And this is precisely
what we do find. The same great trunk impulses that animate men
animate also those more rudimentary but not less real individuals
below and around men. The great primary facts of sex, of
self-preservation, of pleasure and pain, of life and death, of
egoism and altruism, of motherhood, of alimentation, etc.—all of
these are found everywhere, down almost to the very threshold of
organic life. And they are the antecedents of the same great
tendencies as those that control the lives of men. It is often
supposed by the superficial that the facts of sex and alimentation,
which are so prominent in other animals, have been relegated to a
very subordinate place in the nature of man. But nothing could be
much farther from the truth. It has been said that there are only
two things that will induce the typical African or Australian to
undergo prolonged labour—hunger and the sex appetite. It is
probable that men—not only primitive men, but the most evolved
races, including even poets and philosophers—will do more desperate
and idiotic things and undergo more trying experiences when
actuated by the sex impulse than from the effects of any other
impulse in human nature. This impulse is especially overmastering
in races like the Italian and Spanish, and has been mentioned by
ethnologists as a probable factor in the deterioration of these
races. The sentiments of love, marital affection, and family life
control mankind more completely than any other motives. And next to
these comes hunger. Let anyone who imagines that only the non-human
creatures are carnal observe with what uniformity almost every
function in both savage and civilised life gravitates toward eating
and drinking. If it is a picnic, a convention, a national holiday,
a Christmas celebration, a meeting of a fraternal society, a
thanksgiving ceremony, or what not, eating is one of the main
things, and the one exercise into which four-fifths of those
present probably enter with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The human soul is the blossom, not the beginning, of psychic
evolution. Mother-love compassionated infancy long before a babe
came from the stricken loins of woman. The inhabitants of the earth
had been seeking pleasure and seeking to avoid pain, and seeking
ever with the same sad futility, long before man with his retinue
of puny philosophies strutted upon the scene. Hate poisoned the
cisterns of the sea and dropped its pollutions through the steaming
spaces ages before there was malice among men. Altruism is older
than the mountains, and selfishness hardened the living heart
before the continents were lifted. There was wonder in the woods
and in the wild heart of the fastnesses before there were waitings
in synagogues and genuflections about altar piles. The frogs,
crickets, and birds had been singing love a thousand generations
and more when the first amoroso knelt in dulcet descant to a
beribboned Venus. Human nature is not an article of divine
manufacture, any more than is the human form. It came out of the
breast of the bird, out of the soul of the quadruped. The human
heart does not draw back from the mysterious dissolutions of death
more earnestly than does the hare that flees before resounding
packs or the wild-fowl that reddens the reeds with its
flounderings. Bowerbirds build their nest-side resorts, decorate
them with gay feathers, and surround them with grounds ornamented
with bright stones and shells, for identically the same reason as
human beings design drawing-rooms, hang them with tapestries, and
surround them with ornamented lawns. The scarlet waistcoat of the
robin and the flaming dresses of tanagers and humming-birds, which
seem, as they flash through the forest aisles, like shafts of
cardinal-fire, serve the same vanities and minister to the same
instincts as the plumage of the dandy and the tints and gewgaws of
gorgeous dames. Art is largely a manifestation of sex, and it is
about as old and about as persistent as this venerable impulse. How
did Darwin’s dog know his master on his master’s return from a
five-years’ trip around the world? Just as the boy remembers where
the strawberries grow and the philosopher recalls his facts—by that
power of the brain to retain and to reproduce past impressions. Why
does the thinker search his soul for new theories and the spaces
for new stars? For the same reason that the child asks questions
and the monkey picks to pieces its toys. What is reason? A habit of
wise men—an expedient of ants—a mania the fools of all ages are
free from. All of the activities of men, however imposing or
peculiar, are but elaborations in one way or another of the humble
doings of the animalcule, whose home is a water-drop and whose
existence can be discovered by human senses only by the aid of
instruments.</p>
<p>10. Mind has evolved because the universe has evolved. Whether
mind is a part of the universe, or all of it, or only an attribute
of it, it is, in any case, inextricably mixed up with it. And,
since the universe as a whole has evolved, it is improbable that
any part of it or anything pertaining to it has remained impassive
to the general tendency. There are no solids. Nothing stands. The
whole universe is in a state of fluidity. Even the ‘eternal hills,’
the ‘unchanging continents,’ and the ‘everlasting stars,’ are
flowing, flowing ever, slowly but ceaselessly, from form to form.
So is mind. Indeed, if there is anywhere in the folds of creation a
being such as the one whom man has long accused of having brought
the universe into existence, we may rest assured that even he is
not sitting passively apart from the enormous enterprise which he
has himself inaugurated.</p>
<p>The evidence is conclusive. The evolution of mind is supported
by a series of facts not less incontrovertible and convincing than
that by which physical evolution is established. The data of mental
evolution are not quite so definite and plentiful as those of
physical evolution. But this is due to the greater intangibility of
mental phenomena and to the backward condition of the psychological
sciences, especially of comparative psychology. Mental phenomena
are always more difficult to deal with than material phenomena, and
hence are always more tardily attended to in the application of any
theory. But taking everything into account, including the close
connection between physical and psychical phenomena, it may be
asserted that it is not more certain that the physical structure of
man has been derived from sub-human forms of life than it is that
the human mind has also been similarly derived.</p>
<p>Man is the adult of long evolution. The human soul has ancestors
and consanguinities just as the body has. It is just as reasonable
to suppose that the human physiology, with its definitely
elaborated tissues, organs, and systems, is unrelated to the
physiology of vertebrates in general, and through vertebrate
physiology to the physiology of invertebrates, as to suppose that
the states and impulses constituting human nature and consciousness
began to exist in the anthropic type of anatomy and are unrelated
to the states and impulses of vertebrate consciousness in general,
and through vertebrate consciousness to those remoter types of
sentiency lying away at the threshold of organic life. Human
psychology is a part of universal psychology. It has been evolved.
It has been evolved according to the same laws of heredity and
adaptation as have physiological structures. And it is just as
impossible to understand human nature and psychology unaided by
those wider prospects of universal psychology as it is to
understand the facts of human physiology unaided by analogous
universalisations.</p>

<h3 id="part2-chapter3">III. The Common-sense View.</h3>
<p>But it is not necessary to be learned in Darwinian science in
order to know that non-human beings have souls. Just the ordinary
observation of them in their daily lives about us—in their comings
and goings and doings—is sufficient to convince any person of
discernment that they are beings with joys and sorrows, desires and
capabilities, similar to our own. No human being with a
conscientious desire to learn the truth can associate intimately
day after day with these people—associate with them as he himself
would desire to be associated with in order to be interpreted,
without presumption or reserve, in a kind, honest, straightforward,
magnanimous manner; make them his friends and really enter into
their inmost lives—without realising that they are almost unknown
by human beings, that they are constantly and criminally
misunderstood, and that they are in reality beings actuated by
substantially the same impulses and terrorised by approximately the
same experiences as we ourselves. They eat and sleep, seek pleasure
and try to avoid pain, cling valorously to life, experience health
and disease, get seasick, suffer hunger and thirst, co-operate with
each other, build homes, reproduce themselves, love and provide for
their children, feeding, defending, and educating them, contend
against enemies, contract habits, remember and forget, learn from
experience, have friends and favourites and pastimes, appreciate
kindness, commit crimes, dream dreams, cry out in distress, are
affected by alcohol, opium, strychnine, and other drugs, see, hear,
smell, taste, and feel, are industrious, provident and cleanly,
have languages, risk their lives for others, manifest ingenuity,
individuality, fidelity, affection, gratitude, heroism, sorrow,
sexuality, self-control, fear, love, hate, pride, suspicion,
jealousy, joy, reason, resentment, selfishness, curiosity, memory,
imagination, remorse—all of these things, and scores of others, the
same as human beings do.</p>
<p>The anthropoid races have the same emotions and the same ways of
expressing those emotions as human beings have. They laugh in joy,
whine in distress, shed tears, pout and apologise, and get angry
when they are laughed at. They protrude their lips when sulky or
pouting, stare with wide open eyes in astonishment, and look
downcast when melancholy or insulted. When they laugh, they draw
back the corners of their mouth and expose their teeth, their eyes
sparkle, their lower eyelids wrinkle, and they utter chuckling
sounds, just as human beings do.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote1" id="part2-chapter3-ref1" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup> They have strong
sympathy for their sick and wounded, and manifest toward their
friends, and especially toward the members of their own family, a
devotion scarcely equalled among the lowest races of mankind. They
use rude tools, such as clubs and sticks, and resort to cunning and
deliberation to accomplish their ends. The orang, when pursued,
will throw sticks at his pursuers, and when wounded, and the wound
does not prove instantly fatal, will sometimes press his hand upon
the wound or apply grass and leaves to stop the flow of blood. The
children of anthropoids wrestle with each other, and chase and
throw each other, just as do the juveniles of human households. The
gorilla, chimpanzee, and orang all build for themselves lodges made
of broken boughs and leaves in which to sleep at night. These
lodges, rude though they are, are not inferior to the habitations
of many primitive men. The Puris, who live naked in the depths of
the Brazilian forests, do not even have huts to live in, only
screens made by setting up huge palm-leaves against a
cross-pole.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote2" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref2" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup> Some of the African
tribes are said to live largely in caves and the crevices of rocks.
This is the case with many primitive men. According to a writer in
the <em>Journal</em> of the Anthropological Institute of Great
Britain and Ireland (January, 1902), ‘common forms of dwelling
among the wild tribes of the Malay Peninsula are rock-shelters
(sometimes caves, but more commonly natural recesses under
overhanging ledges) and leaf-shelters, which are sometimes formed
on the ground and sometimes in the branches of trees. The simplest
form of these leaf-shelters consists of a single palm-leaf planted
in the ground to afford the wanderer some slight shelter for the
night.’</p>
<p>When they sleep, the anthropoids sometimes lie stretched out,
man-like, on their backs, and sometimes they lie on their side with
their hand under their head for a pillow. The orang retires about
five or six o’clock in the evening, and does not rise until the
morning sun has dissipated the mists of the forest. The gorilla and
chimpanzee seem to mate for life. The former lives, as a rule, in
single families, each family consisting of a male and a female and
their children. During the day this primitive family roams through
the forests of equatorial Africa in search of food. They live on
fruits and nuts and the tender shoots and leaves of plants. They
are especially fond of sugar-cane, which they eat in small-boy
fashion by chewing and discarding the juiceless pulp. Among the
foods of the gorilla is a walnut-like nut which it cracks with
stones. As evening comes on, the head of the family selects a
sleeping-place for the night. This is usually some low tree with a
dense growth at the top, and protected as much as possible by
higher trees from the chilly night wind. Here, on a bed of broken
branches and leaves, the mother and little ones go to sleep, while
the father devotedly crouches at the foot of the tree, with his
back against the trunk to guard his family from leopards and other
nocturnal cut-throats who eat apes.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote3" id="part2-chapter3-ref3a" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref3a">[3a]</a></small></sup> When the weather is
stormy, they cover themselves with broad pandanus leaves to keep
off the rain. Koppenfels relates an incident of a gorilla family
which makes one think of things he sometimes sees among men. The
family consisted of the parents and two children. It was meal-time.
The head of the family reposed majestically on the ground, while
the wife and children hustled for fruits for him in a near-by tree.
If they were not sufficiently nimble about it, or if they were so
wanton as to take a bite themselves, the paterfamilias growled and
gave them a cuff on the head.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote3" id="part2-chapter3-ref3b" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref3b">[3b]</a></small></sup> Notwithstanding the
sensational tales of the ferocity of this being, the gorilla never
attacks anyone at any time unless he is
molested.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote3" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref3c" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref3c">[3c]</a></small></sup> He much prefers to
attend to his own business. But if he is not allowed to do so, if
he is attacked, he is as fearless as a machine. He approaches his
antagonist walking upright and beating his breast with his fists.
He presents one of the most terrifying of all spectacles, as, with
gleaming eyes, hair erect, and resounding yells, he bears down on
the object of his resentment. The natives fear the gorilla more
than they fear any other animal.</p>
<p>The chimpanzee in his native wilds lives in small tribes
consisting of a few families each. Like the gorilla, it passes the
most of its time on the ground, going among the trees only for food
or sleep. It builds a sleeping-place at night in the trees, as in
the case of the gorilla. Brehm, who brought up a number of
chimpanzees in his own home as comrades and playmates of his
children, and who studied them and associated with them for years,
says: ‘The chimpanzee is not only one of the cleverest of all
creatures, but a being capable of deliberation and judgment.
Everything he does is done consciously and deliberately. He looks
upon all other animals, except man, as very inferior to himself. He
treats children entirely different from grown-up people. The latter
he respects; the former he looks upon as comrades and equals. He is
not merely inquisitive: he is greedy for knowledge. He can draw
conclusions, can reason from one thing to another, and apply the
results of experience to new circumstances. He is cunning, even
wily, has flashes of humour, indulges in practical jokes, manifests
moods, and is entertained in one company and bored in another. He
is self-willed but not stubborn, good-natured but not wanting in
independence. He expresses his emotions like a human being. In
sickness he behaves like one in despair, distorts his face, groans,
stamps, and tears his hair. He learns very easily whatever is
taught him, as, for instance, to sit upright at table, to eat with
knife and fork and spoon, to drink from a glass or cup, to stir the
sugar in his tea, to use a napkin, to wear clothes, to sleep in a
bed, and so on. Exceedingly appreciative of every caress, he is
equally sensitive to blame and unkindness. He is capable of deep
gratitude, and he expresses it by shaking hands or kissing without
being asked to do so. He behaves toward infants with touching
tenderness. The behaviour of a sick and suffering chimpanzee is
most pathetic. Begging piteously, almost humanly, he looks into his
master’s face, receives every attempt to help him with warm thanks,
and soon looks upon his physician as a benefactor, holding out his
arm to him, stretching out his tongue whenever told, and even doing
so of his own accord after a few visits from his physician. He
swallows medicines readily, and even submits to surgical
operations—in short, behaves very like a human patient in similar
circumstances. As his end approaches, he becomes more gentle, and
the nobler traits of his character stand out
prominently’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote4" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref4a" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref4a">[4a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p><em>The New York Herald</em>, in its issue of July 2, 1901,
contained an account of the death of Charlemagne, a chimpanzee who
died a short time before at Grenoble, France. This anthropoid at
the time of his death was the most popular inhabitant of the town.
His popularity was due to his good-nature and intelligence, and
especially to the fact that a few years before his death he had
saved a child from drowning in a well. The ape saw the child fall,
and without a moment’s hesitation climbed down the rope used for
the buckets, seized the child, and climbed out again by the same
rope by which he had descended. The people of the town thought so
much of him that they followed his remains to the grave, and the
municipal council voted to erect a bronze statue to his memory.</p>
<p>A heartless hunter—maybe one of those assassins who fill the
wilds with widows and orphans in the name of Science—tells of the
murder of a mother chimpanzee and her baby in Africa. The mother
was high up in a tree with her little one in her arms. She watched
intently, and with signs of the greatest anxiety, the hunter as he
moved about beneath, and when he took aim at her the poor doomed
thing motioned to him with her hand precisely in the manner of a
human being, to have him desist and go away.</p>
<p>According to Emin Pasha, who was for a number of years Governor
of an Egyptian province on the Upper Nile, and whom Stanley made
his last expedition to ‘rescue,’ chimpanzees sometimes make use of
fire. He told Stanley that, when a tribe of chimpanzees who resided
in a forest near his camp came at night to get fruit from the
orchards, they always came bearing torches to light them on their
way. ‘If I had not seen it with my own eyes,’ he declares, ‘I never
could have believed that these beings have the power of making
fire’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote5" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref5" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref5">[5]</a></small></sup> This same authority
relates that on one occasion a band of chimpanzees descended upon
his camp and carried off a drum. The marauders went away in great
glee, beating the drum as they retreated. He says he heard them
several times after that, at night, beating their drum, in the
forest.</p>
<p>The monkeys are little inferior to the man-like races in their
intelligence and in the general similarity of their feelings and
instincts to those of men. Monkeys live in tribes, and at the head
of each tribe is an old male chief who has won his place by his
strength, courage, and ability. Monkeys have excellent memories and
keen observation, and are able to recognise their friends in a
crowd even after long absences. They are proverbially imitative,
have a strong desire for knowledge, and are exceedingly sensitive
and sympathetic in their natures. Sympathy and curiosity, the two
most prominent traits in simian psychology, are, significantly, the
two most important facts in the psychology of man. Sympathy and
curiosity lie at the foundation of human civilisation, sympathy at
the foundation of morals, and curiosity of invention and science.
The monkey whose diary appears in the closing pages of Romanes’
‘Animal Intelligence’ was possessed of an almost ravenous desire to
know. He spent hour after hour in exploration, examining with the
indomitable patience of a scientist everything that came within the
bounds of his little horizon. And when he had found out any new
thing, he was as delighted over it as a boy who has solved a hard
problem, repeating the experiment over and over until it was
thoroughly familiar to him. Among the many things he discovered for
himself was the use of the lever and the screw. Monkeys are the
most affectionate of all animals excepting dogs and men. This
affection reaches its culmination, as among men, in the love of the
mother for her child. The mother monkey’s little one is the object
of her constant care and affection. She nurses and bathes it, licks
it and cleans its coat, and folds it in her arms and rocks it as if
to lull it to sleep, just as human mammas do. She divides every
bite with her little one, but does not hesitate to chastise it with
slaps and pinches when it is rude. The monkey child is generally
very obedient, obedient enough for an example to many a human
youngster.</p>
<p>‘Very touching,’ says Brehm, from whom many of the foregoing
facts are gleaned, ‘is the conduct of the mother when her baby is
obviously suffering. And if it dies she is in despair. For hours,
and even for days, she carries the little corpse about with her,
refuses all food, sits indifferently in the same spot, and often
literally pines to death’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote4" id="part2-chapter3-ref4b" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref4b">[4b]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Orphan monkeys, according to Brehm, are often adopted by the
tribe, and carefully looked after by the other monkeys, both male
and female. The great mass of human beings, who know about as much
about the real emotional life of monkeys as wooden Indians do, are
inclined to pass over lightly all displays of feeling by these
people of the trees. But the poet knows, and the prophet knows, and
the world will one day understand, that in the gentle bosoms of
these wild woodland mothers glow the antecedents of the same
impulses as those that cast that blessed radiance over the lost
paradise of our own sweet childhood. The mother monkey who gathered
green leaves as she fled from limb to limb, and frantically stuffed
them into the wound of her dying baby in order to stanch the cruel
rush of blood from its side, all the while uttering the most
pitiful cries and casting reproachful glances at her human enemy,
until she fell with her darling in her arms and a bullet in her
heart, had in her simian soul just as genuine mother-love, and love
just as sacred, as that which burns in the breast of woman.</p>
<p>The affection of monkeys is not confined to the love of the
mother for her child, but exists among the different members of the
same tribe, and extends even to human beings, especially to those
who make any pretensions to do to them as they would themselves be
done by. The monkey kept by Romanes, already referred to, became so
attached to his master that he went into the wildest demonstrations
of joy whenever his master, after an absence, came into the room.
Standing on his hind-legs at the full length of his chain, and
reaching out both hands as far as he could reach, he screamed with
all his might. His joy was so hysterical that it was impossible to
carry on any kind of conversation until he had been folded in his
master’s arms, when he immediately grew quiet.</p>
<p>‘After I took this monkey back to the Zoological Gardens,’ says
Romanes, ‘and up to the time of his death, he remembered me as well
as the day he was returned. I visited the monkey-house about once a
month, and whenever I approached his cage he saw me with astounding
quickness—indeed, generally before I saw him—and ran to the bars,
through which he thrust both hands with every expression of joy.
When I went away he always followed me to the extreme end of the
cage, and stood there watching me as long as I remained in
sight.’</p>
<p>The following account of the attachment of a male monkey for his
murdered consort is a pitiful tale of human inhumanity and of
simian tenderness and devotion:</p>
<p>‘A member of a shooting-party killed a female monkey, and
carried her body to his tent under a banyan-tree. The tent was soon
surrounded by forty or fifty of the tribe, who made a great noise
and threatened to attack the aggressor. When he presented his
fowling-piece, the fearful effects of which they had just
witnessed, and appeared perfectly to understand, they retreated.
The leader of the troop, however, stood his ground, threatening and
chattering furiously. At last, finding threats of no avail, the
broken-hearted creature came to the door of the tent and began a
lamentable moaning, and by the most expressive signs seemed to beg
for the dead body of his beloved. It was given to him. He took it
sorrowfully in his arms and bore it away to his expecting
companions’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote6" id=

<p>The chattering of monkeys is not, as is vulgarly supposed,
meaningless vocalisation. It is language. It is meaningless to
human ears for the same reason that the chattering of Frenchmen is
meaningless to Americans—<em>because human beings are
foreigners</em>. The conversation of monkeys is to convey thought.
Every species that thinks and feels has means for conveying its
thoughts and feelings, and the means for this exchange, whether it
be sounds, symbols, gestures, or grimaces, is language. As Wundt
somewhere says: ‘If psychologists of to-day, ignoring all that an
animal can express through gestures and sounds, limit the
possession of language to human beings, such a conclusion is
scarcely less absurd than that of many philosophers of antiquity
who regarded the languages of barbarous nations as animal cries.’
Mr. Garner, who has so long and so sympathetically associated with
monkeys, has been able to translate a number of their words and to
enter into slight communication with them. Among the words he has
been able to understand are the words for ‘alarm,’ ‘good-will,’
‘listen,’ ‘food,’ ‘drink,’ ‘monkey,’ and ‘fruit.’ According to him,
the simian tongue has about eight or nine sounds which may be
changed by modulation into three or four times that number, and
each different species or kind has its own peculiar tongue slightly
shaded into dialects. There may be more discriminating students
than Garner, but few certainly who have approached their favourite
problem with more feeling and humanity. Every one should read his
beautiful book on ‘The Speech of Monkeys.’ ‘Among the little
captives of the simian race,’ says he tenderly, in closing his
chapter on the emotional character of these people, ‘I have many
little friends to whom I am attached, and whose devotion to me is
as warm and sincere, so far as I can see, as that of any human
being. I must confess that I cannot discern in what intrinsic way
the love they have for me differs from my own for them; nor can I
see in what respect their love is less divine than is my own.’</p>
<p>Dogs are distinguished for their great intelligence, the
pre-eminence of the sense of smell, fidelity to duty, nobleness of
nature, patience, courage, and affection. In all of these
particulars many individual dogs are superior to whole races of
men. Dogs are more sensitive to physical suffering than savages,
and will cry piteously from slight wounds or other injuries. Dogs
of high life have genuine feelings of dignity and self-respect, and
are easily wounded in their sensibilities. Such dogs have
considerable sense of propriety, and suffer, like sensitive
children, from disapprobation. Romanes had a dog that was so
sensitive that he resented insult, and so sympathetic that he
always fought in defence of other dogs when they were punished or
attacked. When out driving with his master, this dog always caught
hold of his master’s sleeve every time the horse was touched with a
whip.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote6" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref6b" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref6b">[6b]</a></small></sup> Romanes also tells of
a Scotch terrier who, having grown old and useless, and been
supplanted by a younger dog, Jack, became painfully jealous, and
imitated his rival in everything that he did, even to ridiculous
details, in order to retain the attentions of the household. When
Jack was tenderly caressed, the old dog would watch for a time, and
then burst out whining as if in the deepest
distress.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote6" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref6c" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref6c">[6c]</a></small></sup> Dogs communicate
their ideas to each other and to human beings, generally by means
of sounds and gestures. They growl in anger, yelp in eagerness,
howl in despair, bark in joy or warning, bay in wonder, wail in
bitterness and pain, whine in supplication, and prostrate
themselves in submission or apology. It has been said that there
never was a man who possessed the stateliness of a St. Bernard, the
unerring sagacity of the collie, or the courage and tenacity of the
bulldog. The vainest dandy is not more delicate in his ways than
the Italian greyhound, nor more soft and affectionate than the
Blenheim. Many a deed of heroism has been done by dogs which would,
if done by men, have been honoured by the Order of the Victoria
Cross. The St. Bernards belonging to the monks on the passes
between Switzerland and Italy are especially celebrated for their
devotion to the business of saving human life. They often lose
their own lives in their efforts to rescue travellers baffled and
overcome by storm. One particularly sagacious individual, who lost
his life in this way some years ago, wore a medal stating that he
had been the means of saving twenty-two human lives. In devotion
the dog is superior to all other animals, not even excepting man.
‘How could one get relief from the endless dissimulation, falsity,
and malice of mankind,’ exclaimed Schopenhauer in one of his
inspired moments, ‘if there were no dogs into whose honest faces he
could look without distrust?’ A dog will follow a handful of rags
wrapped around a homeless beggar, day after day, through heat and
cold and storm and starvation, just as faithfully as he will follow
the purple of a king. The dog who stood over the lifeless body of
his master, grieving for recognition and starting at every flutter
of his garments, till he himself died of starvation, had in his
faithful breast a nobler heart than that which beats in the bosom
of most men. And the devotion of Greyfriars Bobby, who every night
for twelve years, in all kinds of weather, slept on his master’s
grave, was well worthy the marble tribute which to-day stands in
Edinburgh to his memory. There has never been recorded in the
history of the world an instance of more extravagant trust and
devotion than that told of the canine companion of a certain
vivisector, which licked the hand of his master while undergoing
the crime of being cut to pieces. Such deeds of self-sacrifice
remind one of the tales told of imaginary saints. But they are the
deeds of <em>only dogs</em>—of beings whom half the world look upon
with indifference and contempt, and whom the other half would feel,
if they came within reach, under the strictest obligations to
kick.</p>

<p>I am not one of those who regard the evidence for the
post-mortem existence of the human soul as being either abundant or
conclusive. But of one thing I am positive, and that is, that there
are the same grounds precisely for believing in the immortality of
the bird and the quadruped as there are for the belief in human
immortality. And it is delightful to find great thinkers like
Haeckel, great biologists and philosophers, holding the same
conviction. Haeckel is the giant of the Germans, and in his
brilliant book ‘The Riddle of the Universe’ appears this rather
poetical paragraph: ‘I once knew an old head-forester, who, being
left a widower and without children at an early age, had lived
alone for more than thirty years in a noble forest of East Prussia.
His only companions were one or two servants, with whom he
exchanged merely a few necessary words, and a great pack of
different kinds of dogs, with whom he lived in perfect psychic
communion. Through many years of training this keen observer and
friend of nature had penetrated deep into the individual souls of
his dogs, and he was as convinced of their personal immortality as
he was of his own. Some of his most intelligent dogs were, in his
impartial estimation, at a higher stage of psychic development than
his old stupid maid and his rough and wrinkled man-servant. Any
unprejudiced observer who will study the psychic phenomena of a
fine dog for a year, and follow attentively the processes of its
thought, judgment, and reason, will have to admit that it has just
as valid a claim to immortality as man himself.’</p>
<p>Fido was a shaggy terrier who lived years ago in the old home on
the farm by the beautiful brook. He was one of the very first
acquaintances the writer of these lines made on coming into
existence. In his earlier years, before age had dimmed his mind and
rheumatism had fastened upon him, he was an exceedingly agreeable
and clever canine, active in all the affairs of the farm. He knew
the old homestead by heart, and he took about as much interest in
having everything go right as anybody—more, perhaps, even than we
boys did. He chased the pigs out of the orchard without being asked
to do so, and guarded the house at night with the vigilance of a
hired watchman. He seemed to realise the demands of everyday
situations about as well as any of us. He could distinguish between
neighbours who were accustomed to come on the premises and
strangers who were not. He always knew when company came, for he
invariably attempted to profit by the fact. He had been taught
early the propriety of keeping in the background when his tyrants
were feeding, and ordinarily on such occasions he slept dutifully
by the kitchen stove. But just as sure as a guest sat at table,
Fido would turn up, and, tapping the visitor gently to get his
attention, would sit up perfectly straight, with his paws pendent
and a peculiar grin on his face, in expectation of a morsel. Dear
old Fido! How much he thought of all of us! And how meagerly, as I
know now, were his matchless love and services requited; On Sundays
sometimes the human members of the household would go away and stay
all day, and Fido and the cat would be left alone to get along the
best way they could. He knew as well as any of us when these days
came around, and he dreaded them. I suppose he had learned from
experience to associate cessation of farm work and peculiar
preparations with a day alone. The long, lonely hours probably
affected him somewhat as they do a human being who is compelled to
stay alone all day with nothing to do. But what a welcome he gave
us in the evening when we came back! This was indubitable evidence
of his loneliness. The first familiar object we would see in the
evening, on coming in sight of home, was faithful Fido, sitting out
in the road on the hill above the house—sitting straight up in that
peculiar way of his—watching and waiting for our home-coming. He
knew, or seemed to know, the direction from which to expect us, and
was able to recognise us a long way off. The years have been many,
and Fido’s dust has long been scattered by the gusts over the farms
of north-west Missouri; but now, in fancy, I can see this faithful
creature bounding down the road in the sunset to meet us, as he
used to do in the golden long-ago, leaping and smiling and wagging
his tail, and wriggling and barking in a perfect ecstasy of
gladness.</p>
<p>Well, I <em>know</em> Fido could feel and think, that he loved
and feared and longed and dreaded and dreamed and hated and grieved
and sympathised and reasoned and rejoiced—in short, that he was
moved by about the same passions and considerations as human beings
usually are. He gave the same evidence of it precisely as a human
being does.</p>
<p>The dog is the oldest of human associates. Long before the
historical period the dog was domesticated in Europe, Asia, and
Africa. No race of men is too primitive to be without the dog. The
bones of the dog are found in the middens of the Baltic, and rude
representations of it are chiseled on the oldest monuments of Egypt
and Assyria. The dog was the servant of man away in paleolithic
times, when the mastodon was on earth, and man was a naked
troglodyte, and Europe extended westward to the Azores. And he has
been a faithful friend, a tireless ally, and an enthusiastic slave
of a thankless and inhuman master ever since.</p>
<p>Birds are pre-eminently emotional and artistic. This is shown by
their fondness for singing, their fine dress, their pining for
their dead, their dainty architecture, their pretty forms and
manners of life, their joyousness, and their love for their young.
Birds are the most beautiful and engaging of all terrestrial
beings. Endowed with the power of flight, eminently active,
light-hearted and free, attired in all the colours of the rainbow,
and with voices of unrivalled richness and melody, birds are the
admiration and envy of all of those that dwell on the earth. Birds
possess naturally and in marvellous perfection that power of
locomotion which has been so long sought for by slow-shuffling man.
Birds are also incomparable musicians, no other animals, not even
men, approaching them in the surpassing brilliancy and sweetness of
their song. No human musician in high-sounding hall can equal the
artless lay of the wild bird ringing melodiously through the leafy
colonnades of the woods. Like men, birds sing chiefly of love; but
they also sing for pastime or pleasure. Their singing is sweetest
during the season of courtship, and attains its highest development
in the males. Birds are ardent lovers. To win their brides, the
males contend with each other, and display their charms of plumage
and song with the wildness of human Romeos.</p>
<p>The song of birds is generally acquired by inheritance from the
species, but is sometimes borrowed by imitation from other birds,
or even from other animals. Birds taken from their species when
young, before they have heard their native song, sing generally the
song of their kind, but it is likely to be interspersed with notes
and phrases from the birds around them. Birds thus isolated have
been known to adopt entirely the song of their surroundings. Olive
Thorne Miller vouches for the fact that an English sparrow she once
knew grew up in company with a canary, and came in time to sing the
song of its more talented companion to perfection. It must have
been a Shakspere of a bird, however, to have soared so high above
the excruciating accomplishments of the generality of its
species.</p>
<p>The songs of birds can be set to music just as the melodies of
men can. The songs of several birds were published in the
<em>American Naturalist</em> a few years ago. And Winchell, the
well-known English student of birds, has written a clever book on
the ‘Cries and Call-notes of Wild Birds,’ in which he prints the
calls and songs of most of the native birds of England. According
to this writer, who has perhaps studied the music of birds more
critically than anyone else, the song of the nightingale, when
printed in the notation of ordinary human music, is like a piano
solo. It is made up of a score or so of different strains, with
trills and crescendos, and all executed in so inimitable a manner
that it is unrecognisable when repeated on a musical instrument or
the human voice. One of these strains, curiously enough, is
identical with the song of a certain bush-warbler of western
Canada—as if the English vocalist had plagiarised the song of its
humbler cousin in compiling its incomparable repertoire. The song
of the mocking-bird is a magnificent medley, made up of the calls,
trills, twitters, warbles, warnings, and love-songs, of a score or
more of other birds. I have heard this bird along the Solomon and
Arkansas valleys repeat in the most perfect manner the notes and
songs of the pewee, purple martin, kingbird, flicker, blue jay,
catbird, canary, crow, English sparrow, red-headed woodpecker,
quail, cardinal, cuckoo, robin, red-wings, grackle, meadowlark,
night-hawk, whip-poor-will, besides many other calls and notes,
perhaps of birds I did not know. In the case of some of these birds
the mocker made all of the different sounds of each bird. The song
of the mocking-bird is delivered at any time, day or night, and
generally in a state of high ecstasy and excitement, the performer
flying from tree to tree and from house-top to barn-top,
occasionally throwing himself into the air in the most absurd
manner, and all the time pouring forth such a stream of melody that
one would think all the birds in the neighbourhood had suddenly
come together and let loose in a grand festival of song.</p>
<p>According to Chapman, many of the notes of birds are language
notes rather than sounds expressive of sentiment. Of the robin this
well-known student of birds says: ‘The song and call-notes of this
bird, while familiar to everyone, are in reality understood by no
one, and offer excellent subjects for the student of bird language.
Its notes express interrogation, suspicion, alarm, and caution, and
it signals to its companions to take wing. Indeed, few of our birds
have a more extended vocabulary.’ Winchell says that the common
English sparrow has as many as seven different notes, which it uses
to express the thoughts and feelings passing through its rather
active but not very highly honoured head: (1) The common note of
address of the male to the female; (2) a note of alarm used by both
male and female adults, but never by the young; (3) an emphatic
alarm note, always uttered by sentinels when a hawk is near or when
a man approaches with a gun; (4) the note of the female when
surrounded by several noisy and contending male rivals; (5) an
autumn cry uttered by the first one of the company perceiving
danger and flying up from the hedges and fields—never uttered by
young, but by adults of both sexes; (6) the love note of both male
and female, used mostly by the female, and generally with a
fluttering or shaking accompaniment of her wings; (7) a curious
note sometimes heard in London—meaning not well understood, but
supposed to be a sort of chuckle or sign of contentment. Each one
of these several different notes may be used to stand for various
ideas depending on the circumstances by being given different
emphasis and inflection, just as in the languages of many primitive
races of men a small vocabulary of words is used to stand for a
much larger number of ideas by being pronounced differently. In the
Chinese language, for instance, the words are increased to three or
four times the original number by modulation; but the same thing is
observed in all languages, both human and non-human. Verbal poverty
is pieced out by verbal variation. We say ać-cent or ac-cent́,
depending on whether we wish to express the idea of a noun or a
verb.</p>
<p>The memory of birds is well developed. Many of them remember the
very grove or meadow, and even the very knot-hole or bush, in which
they built their nest the season before, although in the meantime
they have journeyed over lands and seas and sojourned thousands of
miles away. Every year, for several seasons past, in late summer
and early fall, after the nesting-time is over and the young ones
are all grown, the purple martins have gathered in large numbers
about the Field Columbian Museum, in Jackson Park, Chicago. They
stay here for a few weeks, foraging the surrounding air for insects
by day, and sleeping on the great dome of the Museum by night,
finally flying away to be seen no more in such numbers till next
year. These birds, many of them anyway, must remember from one year
to another this annual assembly here by the big waters, else why
would they come together at this particular spot from all over the
country? I have no doubt that some of them, having sojourned here
year after year for some time, remember well the great ugly
building where they meet, and are more or less familiar with the
surrounding locality from having searched it so often. I wonder
what led to the establishing of the custom in the first place.
Customs do not fall from the skies. And what advantage is there in
the practice? What are they up to as they chirp and wheel in the
air, and flutter up the slopes and sail down again, and perch on
the pinnacles and twitter? Maybe it is a sort of Saratoga for them,
where they all come together ostensibly to dip their bills in the
blue waves, but where sons swell in their new feathers, and sly
mammas find prospects for unmarketable misses.</p>
<p>A parrot has been known to remember the voice of its mistress
after an absence of a year and a half—a very remarkable feat even
for the grey matter of a bird. A flock of geese mentioned by
Romanes showed their knowledge of the arrival of market-day, which
came every two weeks, by assembling regularly on such days, early
in the morning, in front of the town inn where the market was held,
to pick up the corn. They never came on the wrong day; and on one
occasion, when the market was omitted on account of a holiday, here
came the unfailing fowls cackling and shouting as usual in merry
anticipation of their fortnightly feast, but ignorant of the
national necessities which had doomed them to be
disappointed.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote6" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref6d" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref6d">[6d]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Parrots remember and call for their absent friends, and mumble
phrases in their dreams which have been taught to them. These
gifted birds learn long poems by heart, and sing songs with
considerable art. A parrot belonging to the canon of the Cathedral
of Salzburg was given instruction regularly two hours every day for
ten years, from 1830 to 1840. The bird became very proficient in
speech and exceedingly intelligent. It took part in conversations,
whistled tunes, and was able to sing a number of popular songs,
among them an entire aria from Flotow’s opera of
‘Martha’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote7" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref7a" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref7a">[7a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Educated birds though, like educated dogs, horses, cats, mice,
men, and everything else, are very different beings from the
uneducated. Cultivation is a key that unlocks all sorts of
miracles. Cats are cultivated tigers; and the richest grains that
ripen in the fields of men, and the loveliest flowers that blow,
are only educated weeds. Even the flea may be taught to exchange
leaping for walking, to draw a tiny wagon, to ride on the seat, to
fire a toy cannon, and do many other feats.</p>
<p>There is one family of birds in which the superior size,
gorgeousness, and vivacity, usual to the males, are found in the
other sex, the females being the larger and more brightly
coloured—the Phalarope family. Indeed, the members of this small
family not only reverse the usual arrangement of the sexual
characters of birds, but completely upset many of the most
cherished traditions of the avian household. The female does the
wooing, and takes the lead in selecting the nest site. And while
she lays the eggs, the privilege of incubation she hands over
magnanimously to her dull-coloured mate.</p>
<p>Birds have a keen observation and a good deal of that invaluable
faculty known as common-sense. It is wonderful how quickly they
learn to avoid telegraph-wires when these invisible but deadly
gossamers are first stretched across a country, and how unerringly
they keep at safe distances when hunted with firearms. An
experienced crow can tell a cane from a gun-barrel almost as far as
he can see it.</p>
<p>Nearly all birds build nests of some kind in which to cradle
their eggs and young. The cow-bird and cuckoo (European), however,
are exceptions. These birds have the rather human practice of
turning their cares and labours over to somebody else. They are
loafers and parasites. They lay their eggs secretly in the nests of
other birds, where their eggs are hatched and their young cared for
by an alien mother. I have seen a mother song-sparrow hustling
about among the shrubs and grasses for an hour at a time almost,
gathering food for a young cow-bird nearly twice as big as she was,
while her foundling sat phlegmatically at the foot of a tree
chirping and fluttering its wings, and acting as a thankless and
apparently bottomless receptacle for the morsel after morsel
laboriously harvested for it by its tireless little foster-mother.
Sand-martins and kingfishers burrow in the earth and rear their
broods in subterranean cradles; gulls and gamebirds build on the
ground; the flamingoes and barn-swallows build mud nests; the
woodpeckers mine holes in trees; doves and eagles make platforms of
sticks; the tailor-bird bastes living leaves together; the social
weavers construct great straw roofs covering the top of a tree, and
build their nests on the limbs beneath; most singing birds build
daintily-lined baskets, and swing them in trees and bushes.</p>
<p>It is often said that all the birds of a species build their
nests in precisely the same way, and that, while men change and
improve their dwelling-places from generation to generation, birds
build their abodes in the same old way, just as their ancestors
built theirs centuries and centuries ago. This is a favourite
thought with the fogies, with those who change not in their
thinking from the ways hacked out for them centuries and centuries
ago. Birds are like men. Some of them—some races and some
individuals—are much more given to initiative than others. There is
as wide a difference between the hang-bird and the auk in the
construction of their domiciles as between the millionaire and the
savage. And the hang-bird has come by her home-making art through
centuries of improvement, just as the millionaire has arrived at
his. It is believed by ornithologists that the first nests of birds
were the niches of rocks or simple hollows scooped in the sand and
soil, such as are still seen among the more primitive bird races,
and that from these aboriginal beginnings have come, through ages
of evolution, the elaborate creations of the cotton-bird,
weaver-bird, tailorbird, oven-bird, the baya-sparrow, the finches,
and the orioles. The savage who lives unmolested generation after
generation in the same land and country builds his simple hut in
just the same way as his ancestors built theirs, and thinks the
same things his ancestors thought a thousand years before him. Sir
Samuel Baker, in a paper on ‘The Races of the Nile Basin,’ points
out that each tribe of men in eastern Africa, like each species of
bird, has its own peculiar style of hut, and that the huts of the
various tribes are as constant in their types as are the nests of
birds. The same thing is true of their headdresses as of their
huts; and this fixed character exists also in their languages,
customs, and religions. It is only some races of men that are given
to growth and fluidity, and only some men of these special
races.</p>
<p>Right in our own country, among the remote mountain recesses of
Appalachia, surrounded on all sides by the most wonderful
development, material and intellectual, the world has ever seen,
lives a race of rude mountain folk almost as aboriginal in their
ways and views of life, and as unaffected by civilisation, as if
they were in the heart of Africa. They live huddled together in
one-room log-cabins without windows or floors, eat bacon and
cornmeal, carry on almost constant wars, and execute the deputies
of civilisation who happen to stray into their illicit dominions,
just as they have done from the time these mountain silences were
first broken by them 150 or 200 years ago.</p>
<p>Birds, as a rule, use a great deal of care and thought in the
location of their nests. After they have selected a certain grove
or field as the one best suited to their purposes, or as the one
around which cluster the happiest memories, it usually requires
several days of flying and peeping about, of spying and
exploration, before the exact spot for the precious domicile is
finally settled upon. It is a delicate matter for many birds, for
security from sun, storm, and enemies must all be taken into
account. Old birds, as has been frequently observed, build better
nests and select more clever locations for their nests than the
young and inexperienced. The nest-building habits of many birds are
known to have changed during the past few hundred years. The
American house-swallow did most certainly not build under the eaves
of human houses 300 years ago, nor did the hair-bird in her nest
with horsehair as she invariably does now. The fact that wrens,
swifts, and martins now build almost altogether in boxes and
chimneys shows that birds are able and willing to adapt themselves
to new conditions. The chimney-swift and purple martin, it is said,
still cling to their aboriginal custom of rearing their young in
hollow trees in the unsettled parts of America. The indomitable
house-sparrow builds its nest almost anywhere, from knot-holes and
tin cans to electric-light globes and tree-tops. Its original
dwelling was probably an arboreal affair, like that of other
sparrows, and different nesting-places have been adopted as a
result of its association with man. Not only in its architecture,
but in several other ways, this bird has departed from the
traditions of its tribe. The Fringillidae (the sparrow family of
birds) are seed-eaters, both in structure and practice. But the
house-sparrow, since it left the fields and groves to become a
gamin on human streets, has learned to eat almost anything, and one
thing, too, about as cheerfully as another. The varied habits of
this bird are probably due to its natural elasticity in the first
place, supplemented by the unsettling influences of its rather
kaleidoscopic experiences during the past few hundred years.</p>
<p>The fear of birds for man is an acquired trait due to ages of
persecution. If man would treat birds kindly, they would act toward
him as they do toward any other friendly animal. When unfrequented
islands are first visited by man, the birds are found to be
perfectly fearless of him, flying about him, feeding from his hand,
and manifesting no more timidity than if he were a big-hearted bird
himself. Darwin states that, when he stopped at the Galapagos
Islands on his famous trip around the world in the <em>Beagle</em>,
he found the birds there so tame that he could push them from the
branches of the trees with his gun-barrel. Professor Cutting, of
the State University of Iowa, in an article in the <em>Popular
Science Monthly</em> for August, 1903, tells of the almost absolute
fearlessness of the birds on the island of Laysan, an isolated
atoll in the Pacific west of the Hawaian Islands, which he visited
during that summer. The island swarms with bird life—petrels,
albatrosses, and tropical birds of various kinds—and these birds
betray no more fear in the presence of man than if he were a cow.
The albatrosses were so numerous and so indifferent to the presence
of man that it was necessary to shove them aside with one’s foot to
keep from stepping on them when one went for a walk along the
sand-stretches of the shore. Professor Cutting took photographs of
birds which literally posed for him in all sorts of positions, and
half-savage jackies amused themselves by going about and pulling
the pretty tail feathers from the tropical birds as they sat on
their nests. I have known of two cases where persons, by going to
the same place day after day with food and kindness, have in the
course of a few weeks taught robins, sparrows, and other birds, to
lose all fear of them, so much so as to sit on their shoulders and
arms and eat out of their hands. This is the spirit all birds would
show all the time toward their featherless lords if these
featherless ones would only treat them with half the consideration
they merit.</p>
<p>The love of a bird for the treasures of her nest is one of the
most beautiful things of this world. Mother-like, the parent bird
will do anything almost for the sake of her little ones. Who has
not seen the kildeer strive with all the tact of her clever little
soul to allure some big giant of a human being, who has wandered
into her neighbourhood, away from her nest of precious young? Many
a time as a boy on the farm I have followed one of these birds
limping and tumbling and fluttering along on the ground a few feet
ahead of me, utterly disabled, as I supposed, but always managing
to keep just a little beyond the reach of my eager hands. And when
the artful mother has led me far from the sacred spot where lay all
there was in this world to her, how triumphantly she has lifted
herself on her unharmed wings and, to my utter astonishment, sailed
away. The partridge and the mourning-dove are, if possible, even
more artful in their acting than the kildeer. After I became a
large boy and had been told the meaning of these exhibitions by
parent birds, I often followed the mourning-dove, thinking the bird
must be really wounded after all, so perfectly did it pretend. But
the cunning of the kildeer is not confined to luring one away from
the nest. If by some accident one finds her nest (and the nest is
so cleverly concealed that, if it is discovered at all, it will be
by pure accident), the resourceful mother is ready with other
expedients to outwit you. She watches you all the time from the
proper distance, and knows by your conduct the moment you have
found her nest. And before you have even had time to admire the
skill displayed by the mother in blending so perfectly her abode
with its surroundings, a single peculiar note from her has caused
the whole nestful of cuddling young ones to dart out of their
cradle and disappear among the surrounding clods as if by magic. No
amount of searching can find one of them. They have vanished as
effectually as if they had evaporated. And it is enough to touch
the heart of the most indifferent to see the anxious mother bird,
as I have seen her from the cranny of a neighbouring rock-pile,
come back to her nest and call her scattered children together
again after they have once dispersed at her command. Circling
around the nest two or three times to assure herself that no one is
nigh, she alights and begins a low clucking sound like that of a
hen calling her brood. The little ones come out of their
hiding-places one after another as mysteriously as they vanished.
You can’t see for the life of you where they come from. They seem
to just <em>emanate</em>. And if one of them fails to come at her
call—for the devoted mother knows very well just how many she
has—she extends her search farther out from her nest, looking all
around and keeping up that peculiar little cluck, until the
half-scared-to-death little slyboots finally comes creeping out
from his improvised snuggery somewhere. If a kildeer’s nest has
once been found, and the mother feels that it is in danger of
future visits, she will move her family at night to some other
locality, and it is practically impossible ever to find it again.
The family relations of the ring-dotterels are said to be ‘so
charming and touching that even hunters recoil from shooting a
female surrounded by her young ones.’</p>
<p>Human beings, true to their instinct never to call into action
their ability to think if they can employ their faculty for
nonsense instead, call this love of the mother bird ‘machinery.’
But there are some of us (and our numbers are increasing) who are
disposed to put off the adoption of this conclusion until we go
mad. The bird builds her nest, weaving it of the rarest fibres. She
hides it in the copse or prudently hangs it far out on some
inaccessible bough. She lays her beautiful eggs, and hatches them
with the warmth and life of her own breast. She tends her young,
bringing them food and drink, and watching over them with a tender
and tireless vigilance. She protects them in storm with her own
little body, worries about them when danger lurks, and dreams of
them, no doubt, as she rocks and sleeps under the silent stars. She
sings to them in the overflow of her gladness and hope, and risks
her very existence to shield them from harm. She teaches them to
fly, to find their food, and to detect their enemies. She is true
to her mate, and her mate is true and kind to her. As the days of
summer shorten, and the cool, long nights warn of approaching
autumn, she leads her children away from the old place, she and her
faithful mate, out into the wide old world. And I say there is love
in the heart of that mother as truly as in the heart of woman, and
there are joy and genuineness and sorrow and fidelity in that
sylvan home more sacred than may sometimes bloom in the cold
mansions of men.</p>
<p>Conjugal love is also very strong in many of the feathered
races, especially among those in which the wedding is for
successive seasons or for life. The pining of love-birds for their
dead sweethearts is well known. The mandarin duck is proverbial for
its marital faithfulness, and a pair of these fowls is carried by
the Chinese in their marriage processions as an emblem of
constancy. Many instances are recorded of birds, after having been
deprived of their mates, refusing steadfastly the attentions of
other birds, and even sometimes separating themselves entirely from
the society of their kind. The following account of the devotion of
a widowed pigeon for her deceased consort sounds like a tale of
human woe:</p>
<p>‘A man set to watch a field much patronised by pigeons shot an
old male pigeon who had long been an inhabitant of the farm. His
mate, around whom he had for many a year cooed, whom he had
nourished with his own crop and had assisted in rearing numerous
young ones immediately settled on the ground by his side She
refused to leave him, and manifested her grief in the most
expressive manner. The labourer took up the dead bird and hung it
on a stake. The widow still refused to forsake her husband, and
continued day after day slowly walking around the stake on which
his body hung. The kind-hearted wife of the farmer heard of the
matter, and went to the relief of the stricken bird. On arriving at
the spot, she found the poor bird still watching at the side of her
dead, and making an occasional effort to get to him. She was much
spent with her long fasting and grief. She had made a circular
beaten path around the corpse of her
companion’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote8" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref8a" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref8a">[8a]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>And these are the beings whose bones men jest over at their
feasts, and brutes shoot for pastime on human holidays. Much has
been said of the sorrow of birds for their deceased mates, but not
too much. For the avian soul may be smothered by the gloom and
loneliness that come upon the heart, when the great light of love
and companionship has gone out, quite as completely as the soul of
a bereaved human. In not many human homes where loved ones lie sick
and dying are felt the pangs of more genuine grief than those
sometimes suffered by birds when their friends and companions are
stricken in death. The following incident, vouched for by Dr.
Franklin, who observed it, is only one among many such instances
recorded in the literature on birds:</p>
<p>A pair of parrots had lived together on the most loving terms
for four years, when the female was taken with a serious attack of
gout. She grew rapidly worse, and was soon so weak as to be unable
to leave her perch for food, when the male, faithful and tender as
a human spouse, took it upon himself to carry food to her regularly
in his beak. ‘He continued feeding her in this way for four months,
but the infirmities of his companion increased day by day, until at
last she was no longer able to support herself on the perch. She
remained cowering down in the bottom of the cage, making from time
to time ineffectual efforts to regain her perch. The male was
always near her, and did everything in his power to aid the feeble
efforts of his dear better-half. Seizing the poor invalid by the
beak or the upper part of her wing, he tried his best to enable her
to rise, and repeated his efforts several times. His constancy, his
gestures, and his continued solicitude, all showed in this
affectionate bird the most ardent desire to relieve the sufferings
and assist the weakness of his sinking companion. But the scene
became still more affecting when the female was dying. Her unhappy
consort moved about her incessantly, his attentions and tender
cares redoubled. He even tried to open her beak to give some
nourishment. He ran to her, and then returned with a troubled and
agitated look. At intervals he uttered the most plaintive cries;
then, with his eyes fixed on her, kept a mournful silence. At
length his companion breathed her last. From that moment he pined
away, and in the course of a few weeks died’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote6" id="part2-chapter3-ref6e" name=

<p>Even the rough-looking ostrich has sensibility enough to die of
a broken heart, as was the case in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris
a few years ago. There is many a heart with a slabless grave far
from the haunts of men, and many a tear in secret brews that never
wets the eye.</p>
<p>The individual who has never acquired the enthusiasm for a
knowledge of the birds and a love for their presence and
association has omitted some of the richest emotions of life. ‘The
sight of a bird or the sound of its voice is at all times an event
of such significance to me,’ says Chapman, ‘a source of such
unfailing pleasure, that when I go afield with those to whom birds
are strangers I am deeply impressed by the comparative barrenness
of their world, for they live in ignorance of a great store of
enjoyment that might be theirs for the asking.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I cannot love the man who does not love, As men love light, the
song of happy birds.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have seen a mother mouse in a moment of peril flee from her
home among the falling pieces of a cord-wood pile, and disappear
under the roots of a neighbouring oak. I have seen her a little
later, recovered from her initial dismay, making her way back
again, clambering along among the tangled timbers, stopping now and
then to look and listen, her eyes wild and anxious, and her whole
little body quaking with excitement. I have seen her go among the
ruins of her dwelling, take a poor little squeaking young one in
her mouth, and hurry away with it to the gloomy refuge in the roots
of the oak. I have watched her return again and again, each time
taking in her careful teeth the tiny body of a babe, until five
mouthfuls of precious pink were safely lodged within the fortress
of the oak. And I could as soon believe that woman, when she saves
her children from some fearful harm, is a soulless machine as think
that that brave little wood-mother, out there alone under the
trees, snatching her darlings from the jaws of death, was a heroine
without sense or feeling. That little hairy mother with four feet
and bead-like eyes loved her young ones in just the same way and
for just the same reason as a human mother loves her young ones.
She looked upon her babies, in all probability, with the same
mother-love and tenderness as a human mother looks upon hers, and
felt in miniature, with evil hovering above them, the same
consternation a woman feels when destruction reaches out after
those that are nearest and dearest. And when it was all over, when
the good angel of deliverance had finally spread its healing white
wings over that afflicted family, the heart of that little rodent
was doubtless soothed by the same joy as that which, in the hour of
deliverance, calms the hearts of humankind.</p>
<p>Ants tend their fields, gather their harvests, domesticate other
insects, and keep slaves. They help each other bear heavy burdens,
extricate each other from misfortune, speak to each other when they
meet, and bury their dead. They build roads and bridges, and
manifest wonderful engineering skill in their construction. They
even tunnel under rivers. They go far from home, and find their way
back again. They inhabit towns, and build splendid and spacious
palaces. Each ant knows every other citizen of its own town, and an
ant from any other town is immediately recognised as a foreigner.
Ants have their overseers of industrial enterprises, and regular
hours for work and sleep. The ant is the most pugnacious of all
animals, and the most muscular compared with its size. It will
boldly attack the biggest creature that walks if this creature
invades its home. It will fasten its mandibles into an enemy, and
allow itself to be torn to pieces without relaxing its hold. Among
some savage tribes, certain species of ants are said to be used as
surgeons. Infuriated ants are allowed to fasten their mandibles on
the opposite edges of a gash, and in this way the wound is closed.
The ants are decapitated, and their bodiless heads with their
relentless jaws serve as stitches to the wound. Ants have holidays
and athletic festivals. On such occasions they romp and chase each
other and play hide-and-seek like children. They stand on their
hind-legs, embrace each other with their fore-limbs, grasp each
other by the feet or antennae, pull each other down the entrances
to their towns, wrestle and roll over on the sand, and so on—all in
the friendliest manner. It is greatly to the credit of these little
people that no observer has ever yet known them to become so
inventively helpless or so athletically hard up as to play
slug-ball. Ants educate their young, and practise the fundamental
principles of human states and societies. Forel, the great Swiss
student of ants, says that several hundred nests are sometimes
united into a single confederation. Each ant knows every other ant
of the entire confederation, and they all take part in the common
defence. Haeckel says, speaking of social evolution in ants, that
the aboriginal ants of the Chalk Age had as little idea of the
division of labour and organisation of modern ant states as
paleolithic flint-chippers had of the complexity and organisation
of twentieth-century civilisation. ‘If we take an ant’s nest, we
not only see that work of every description—rearing of progeny,
foraging, building, rearing of aphides, and so on—is performed
according to the principles of voluntary mutual aid, but we must
also recognise, with Forel, that the fundamental feature of the
life of many species of ants is the obligation of every ant to
share its food, already swallowed and partly digested, with every
member of the community which may apply for it. Two ants belonging
to the same nest or to the same confederation of nests will
approach each other, exchange a few movements with the antennae,
and if one of them is hungry or thirsty—and especially if the other
has its crop full—it immediately asks for food. The individual thus
requested never refuses. It sets apart its mandibles, takes a
proper position, and regurgitates a drop of transparent fluid,
which is licked up by the hungry ant. Regurgitating food for others
is so prominent a feature in the life of the ants, and it so
constantly recurs both for feeding hungry comrades and for feeding
larvae, that Forel considers the digestive tube of ants to consist
of two different parts, one of which—the posterior—is for the
special use of the individual, and the other—the anterior part—is
chiefly for the use of the community. If an ant which has its crop
full has been selfish enough to refuse to feed a comrade, it will
be treated as an enemy. If the refusal has been made while its
kinsfolks were fighting with some other species, they will fall
upon the greedy individual with greater vehemence even than upon
the enemies themselves. All this has been confirmed by the most
accurate observations and experiments’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote9" id="part2-chapter3-ref9" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref9">[9]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Ants keep slaves. And the slaves, in some instances, carry their
masters about, feed them, groom them, and attend to their every
want, just as human lackeys do helpless aristocrats. In some
species the institution of slavery is so old that the physical
structures of the masters have been modified until the masters are
physically unable to feed themselves, and will perish from hunger,
though surrounded by food, if they are left to themselves. The
brain of the ant, as Darwin says, is one of the most wonderful bits
of matter in the universe. It is scarcely one-fourth the size of
the head of a pin, yet it is the seat of the most astonishing
wisdom and activity. If human intelligence were as great, compared
with the mass of the human brain, as is the ant’s, man would be
several hundred times as wise as he is now, and would then probably
not fall far short of that state of erudition which the average man
imagines he already represents. Ants remember, and a fact becomes
impressed by repetition, showing that the faculty of memory in ants
is governed by the same laws as is this faculty in man. Sir John
Lubbock found it necessary to teach his ants the way by repeating
the lesson where the way was long or unusual. ‘Sensation,
perception, and association follow in the social insects, on the
whole, the same fundamental laws as in the vertebrates, including
ourselves. Furthermore, attention is surprisingly developed in
insects’ (Forel). Ants keep standing armies, make alliances, and
maraud neighbouring states. They have their wars, civil and
foreign, and their massacres and enslavements of the conquered. But
they have never got so low yet, so far as anyone knows, as to
hypocritically prosecute their conquests in the name of God and
humanity. The battlefields of ants resemble the carnage-plains of
men, strewn with ghastly corpses and covered with the headless and
dying. And the accounts of their expeditions—their going forth in
regular columns, with captains, scouts, and skirmish lines, their
battles, and their return laden with plunder and captives—read like
the grisly tales of human history. Ants perform, in short, about
all the antics of civilised man, except maltreating the females and
drinking gin. And shall we say their civilisation is less real
because it is miniature and because it is carried on far below the
Brobdingnagian contemplations of man? ‘When we see an ant-hill
tenanted by thousands of industrious inhabitants, excavating
chambers, forming tunnels, making roads, guarding their home,
gathering food, feeding the young, tending their domestic animals,
each one fulfilling its duties industriously and without confusion,
it is difficult altogether to deny them the gift of reason or to
escape the conviction that their mental powers differ from those of
men not so much in kind as in degree’ (Lubbock).</p>
<p>The industrious and gifted bee, with its wonderful social
system, in advance even of that of the most enlightened societies
of men; the generous horse, who thinks and feels so much more than
the clowns who maul him ever suspect; the artful spider, that
confirmed waylayer lurking in his lair of silk; the soft and
predaceous cat; the timid-hearted hare, poor hounded little dweller
of the fields and stream-sides; the beautiful and vivacious
squirrel; the lowly lady-bug; the cautious fox; the irascible
serpent, so cruelly misunderstood by men; the patient camel; the
scornful peafowl; the indomitable goat; the grave and vindictive
elephant; the ingenious beaver, the woodman of the primeval
wilderness; the lordly and polygamous cock; the maternal hen; the
wary trout, beset everywhere by the villainous traps of impostors;
the bride-like butterfly; the delicate antelope and deer; and the
sturdy, incorruptible ox—all of these beings have within them souls
composed primarily of the same elements as those that compose the
souls of men.</p>
<p>Ground-wasps have been observed to use tiny stones as hammers in
packing the dirt firmly over their nests—a very remarkable act of
intelligence, since the use of tools is not common even among the
higher mammals.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote10" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref10" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref10">[10]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Fishes have been taught to assemble at the ringing of a bell,
and toads and tortoises to come at the call of their favourite
friends. An alligator which was kept tame for several years became
so much attached to its master that ‘it followed him about the
house like a dog, scrambling up the stairs after him, and showing
much affection and docility.’ The favourite friend and companion of
this alligator was the cat; and, whenever the cat stretched herself
on the floor in front of the fire, the alligator would lie down
beside her, with its head on the cat, and go to sleep. ‘When the
cat was absent, the alligator was restless, but it always appeared
happy when the cat was near it’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter3-footnote8" id="part2-chapter3-ref8b" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref8b">[8b]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Wolves and foxes sometimes cooperate with each other in their
hunting expeditions, somewhat as men do in theirs. One of their
number will crouch in ambush by the side of a road known to be used
by hares or other small animals, and leap on the unsuspecting
fugitives when driven that way by others of the hunting band. Many
animals post sentinels when they eat or sleep or engage in other
hazardous undertakings, and these sentinels show a good deal of
discrimination in distinguishing between animals that are friendly
and those that are not. Beavers not only build lodges to live in,
but also construct dams to keep the water in which the villages are
located at a certain height. The outlet of these dams is carefully
regulated, being regularly lessened and enlarged to suit the supply
of water in the stream. The trees used by the beavers in their
enterprises are felled by them along the margins of the stream, and
floated to the place where they are used. In old communities, where
the supply of timber near the stream has been exhausted, artificial
canals are cut by these indomitable engineers for use in the
transportation of their materials. These excavations are made at a
great cost of labour and for the deliberate purpose of enabling the
builders to accomplish that which they could not accomplish in any
other way. ‘In executing this purpose,’ says Romanes, ‘there is
sometimes displayed a depth of engineering forethought over details
of structure required by the circumstances of special localities
which is even more astonishing than the execution of the general
idea’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote6" id=
"part2-chapter3-ref6f" name=
"part2-chapter3-ref6f">[6f]</a></small></sup> When, for instance, a
canal has been carried so far from the original water-supply that,
owing to the rising ground, it cannot be continued without a very
great expenditure of effort in digging, a second dam is built
higher up-stream, and with water drawn from this the canal is
continued on at a higher level. Sometimes a third dam is built
above the second, and the canal again continued at a still higher
level before the valuable timber of the higher grounds is reached.
These enterprising rodents also carve sometimes enormous channels
across the necks of land formed by winding rivers, to serve as
cut-offs in travel and transportation. And yet all of these
things—all of the intelligence, feeling, and ingenuity displayed by
the non-human races—are still lumped together by belated
psychologists under the head of ‘instinct,’ by which is meant a
blind, unconscious knack of doing the right thing without in any
way realising what is being done or what it is being done for! The
principle in accordance with which mind is denied to non-human
beings would, if carried to its legitimate conclusions, make
machines out of all of us, and limit the possession of conscious
intelligence to the individual who promulgates the theory. The
attitude assumed by many psychologists toward the mental faculties
of inferior races reminds one of Heine’s interview with the old
lizard at Lucca. In the discussion which ensued between the poet
and the reptile, the poet dropped the words, ‘I think.’ ‘Think!’
snapped the lizard with a sharp, aristocratic tone of profound
contempt—‘think! Which of you thinks? For 3,000 years, wise sir, I
have investigated the spiritual functions of animals, and I have
made men and apes the special objects of my study. I have devoted
myself to these queer creatures with as great zeal and diligence as
Lyonnet to his caterpillars. And as the result of my researches, I
can assure you no man thinks. Now and then something occurs to him,
and these accidentally occurring somethings he calls thoughts, and
the stringing of them together he calls thinking. But you can take
my word for it, no man thinks—no philosopher thinks. And, so far as
philosophy is concerned, it is mere air and water, like pure
vapours in the sky. There is, in reality, only one true philosophy,
and that is engraven in eternal hieroglyphics on my own
tail’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter3-footnote7" id=

<p>This attitude of the lordly saurian toward the human race is a
stinging burlesque on the anthropocentric conceit which perverts
all of man’s views of the other orders of life.</p>
<p>It is not contended that non-human beings are psychically
identical with human beings. The races of men are not psychically
identical with each other. The difference between the intellectual
splendours of a Spencer evolving volumes of the profoundest
philosophy and the mind of an Australian who cannot count six, or
between the understanding of an Edison, the wizard of the
electrical world, and that of the South Sea islanders, who, when
Captain Cook gave them some English nails, planted them in the hope
of raising a new crop, is almost infinite. The lowest races of men
have neither superstition nor the power of abstract thought as have
the higher races. They have a word for black stone, white stone,
and brown stone, but no word for stone; for elm-tree, oak-tree, and
the like, but no word for tree. As Kingsley says, ‘It is difficult
to believe that a dog does not form as clear an abstract idea of a
tree as these people do.’ There are human beings living in the
forests of Asia, Africa, and Australasia that wander about from
place to place in herds without chief, law, weapons, or fixed
habitations. They go naked, mate by chance, and climb trees like
monkeys. Some of these races know nothing of fire, religion, or a
moral world, chatter to each other like apes, and live on such
natural products as roots, fruits, serpents, mice, ants, and honey.
One of these creatures, we are told, will lie flat on his front for
an hour by the runway of a field-mouse, waiting for a chance to
snatch up the little creature when it comes along and eat it.
Dozens of such degraded races are mentioned by Blichner in his
‘Man: Past, Present, and Future,’ and by Sir John Lubbock in his
‘Origin of Civilisation.’</p>
<p>Non-human beings have, as a rule, neither the psychic variety
nor the intensity of higher humans. And it is not contended that in
language, science, and superstition they are capable of being
compared with the foremost few of civilised societies, any more
than savages, especially the lowest savages, are capable of such
comparison. But it is maintained that the non-human races of the
earth are <em>not</em> the metallic and soulless lot of fixtures
they are vulgarly supposed to be; that they are just as real living
beings, with just as precious nerves and just as genuine feelings,
rights, heartaches, capabilities, and waywardnesses, as we
ourselves: and that, since they are our own kith and kindred, we
have no right whatever, higher than the right of main strength
(which is the right of devils), to assume them to be, and to treat
them as if they were, our natural and legitimate prey.</p>

<h3 id="part2-chapter4">IV. The Elements of Human and Non-human
Mind Compared.</h3>
<p>The analysis of human mind and the comparison of its elements or
powers with the powers of non-human mind corroborate the
conclusions already arrived at through observation and deductive
inference. The chief powers of the mind of man are
<em>sensation</em>, <em>memory</em>, <em>emotion</em>,
<em>imagination</em>, <em>volition</em>, <em>instinct</em>, and
<em>reason</em>. All of these faculties are found in non-human
beings, some of them developed to a much higher degree than they
are in man, and some of them to a much lower.</p>
<p><em>Sensation</em> is the effect produced on the mind when a
sense organ is affected in some way by external stimuli. Sensation
is the lumber of the mind, the raw material out of which are
elaborated all other forms of consciousness. The chief species of
sensation are those of sight, sound, smell, taste, and feeling. The
original sense was feeling, and out of this sense were evolved the
other four. The organs of seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting
are therefore modifications of the skin, which is the organ of
original sense. The fact that in all animals, down almost to the
very beginnings of life, sense organs exist, suggests that
sensation may be almost, if not quite, coextensive with animal
life. All mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes have the
same special sense organs as man, and the organs of sight, sound,
taste, and smell occupy in all vertebrates the same relative
positions in the head. Birds see better than any other animals, and
carnivora smell better. Ruminants see, hear, and smell with great
acuteness. Fishes also see and hear well; and the wings of the bat
are so exceedingly sensitive that it will move about blindfolded
and with ears stopped with cotton almost as unerringly as when
aided by sight and sound. Insects have smell, sight, and taste well
developed, as is shown by their keen appreciation of the colours,
perfumes, and flavours of flowers. They also hear. Stridulation
proves this. Worms have eyes and ears, and land-leeches scent the
approach of their prey at a long distance. The starfish and the
medusa respond to all the five classes of stimuli which affect the
five senses of man, and nervous substance is found in all animals
above the sponge.</p>
<p><em>Memory</em> is the power of retaining or recognising past
states of consciousness. The power to retain impressions follows in
origin close upon the power to receive impressions. Memory is the
historic faculty of the mind—the power of the mind to store up its
experiences—and is found in nearly all animals. The lowly limpet,
whose world is a seaside rock, will come back from its little
roamings time after time to the same rude lodge from which it set
out. Bees remember where they get honey or sugar months afterwards,
and when it is necessary will sometimes go back to the old home
hive which they left the year before. Ants retrace their steps
after making long journeys from their nest, and are able in some
way to recognise their friends after months of separation. The
stickleback (fish) knows the way back to his nest, although he has
been absent several hours. Fishes return and hatch their young year
after year in the same waters; birds come back to their old
nesting-places; and horses remember their way along devious roads
over which they have not been for years. Horses used in the
delivery of milk, or in other occupations in which they are
accustomed to travel daily over about the same route, come in time
to remember every alley, street, and stopping-place of the whole
round almost as accurately as their drivers. Darwin’s dog
remembered and obeyed him after an absence of five years. The power
of dogs, squirrels, and other animals of remembering where they
have long before cached food is indeed wonderful. A squirrel will
come down out of a tree when the earth is covered to a depth of
several inches with lately fallen snow and hop away, without the
slightest hesitancy or mistake, to the exact spot where it has
months before stored its mid-winter acorns. A lion has been known
to recognise its keeper after seven years of separation, and an
elephant obeyed all his old words of command on being recaptured
after fifteen years of jungle life. The similarity of memory in
other animals to the same faculty in man is shown by the fact that
memory everywhere is governed by the same laws. In all animals,
including man, memory is strengthened by repetition—that is,
impressions are always deepened and confirmed by being made over
and over. A parrot or a raven masters a new sentence by working at
it and saying it over and over again, just as a boy memorises his
rules and catechisms.</p>
<p><em>Imagination</em> is the picturing power of the mind. In its
lowest stages of manifestation it is akin to memory. Imagination,
however, in its higher reaches, not only reimages previous
impressions, but combines them in new and original relations.
Imagination is displayed in dreams, images, delusions,
anticipation, and sympathy. It also furnishes wings for speculation
and reason. Spiders, when they attach stones to their webs to
steady them during anticipated gales, probably exercise
imagination. The tame serpent which was carried away from its
master’s house and found its way back again, though the distance
was one hundred miles, no doubt carried in its imagination vivid
pictures of its old home.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote1" id="part2-chapter4-ref1a" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref1a">[1a]</a></small></sup> Cats, dogs, horses,
and other animals dream, and parrots talk in their sleep. Horses
and cattle sometimes stampede at imaginary objects, and often
distort real objects into imaginary monsters. When a horse at night
takes fright at a big black stump by the roadside, he no doubt
imagines it to be some terrible creature ready to eat him up if he
should go near it, just as a timid child does in the same
circumstances. There is a great difference in horses in this
respect, just as there is among children and men, some of them
taking fright at every unusual thing, while others are more bold or
stolid. The cat playing with a ball of yarn converts it by means of
its imagination into an object of prey, just as a girl converts a
doll into a baby, or a boy changes a stick into a steed. Sympathy
is the putting or picturing of one’s self in the place of another,
and by means of the imagination sharing or simulating the psychic
conditions of that other. This high and holy exercise of the
imagination is exhibited by horses, cattle, dogs, deer, elephants,
monkeys, and birds—in fact, by nearly all animals as far down as
the fishes and insects.</p>
<p><em>Emotion</em> is the stirring of the sensibilities by way of
the intellect or the imagination. The following emotions are found
in non-human beings: fear, surprise, affection, pugnacity, play,
pride, anger, jealousy, curiosity, sympathy, emulation, resentment,
appreciation of the beautiful, grief, hate, cruelty, joy,
benevolence, revenge, shame, remorse, and appreciation of the
ludicrous. Excepting the emotions of conscience and religion, which
are really compounds, with fear as the main ingredient, this list
of non-human emotions is coextensive with the list of human
emotions. Many of these emotions germinate low down in the animal
kingdom, fear, anger, sexuality, and jealousy all being found in
fishes and in the higher invertebrates. In the higher vertebrates
many of these emotions are almost as strong as they are in men.
Does anyone who has felt the throbbing sides of a frightened puppy
or hare have any doubt that these creatures suffer the keenest
agony of fear? Apes have been known to fall down and faint when
suddenly confronted by a snake, so great is their instinctive
horror of serpents; and gray parrots, which are extremely nervous
birds, have been known to drop from their perch unconscious under
the influence of great fear.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote2" id="part2-chapter4-ref2" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The horse is, perhaps, of all animals, the one which
occasionally gives itself over most completely to the emotion of
fear, as everyone who has witnessed the terrible abandon of a
runaway team can testify. Ants, fishes, birds, cats, dogs, horses,
monkeys, porpoises, and many other animals play. Young kittens,
colts, and puppies enjoy a scuffle about as well as boys do.
Pugnacity originates among the spiders and insects, and is highly
developed in the ant, cock, and bulldog. This emotion is strong in
the males of nearly all vertebrates. Anyone who has observed the
vigilance displayed by fishes in protecting their nests can have
little doubt that these comparatively primitive beings possess
pugnacity. I was one evening floating in a boat by the edge of a
Long Island pond just over a village of perches. Each nest was
guarded by an assiduous male, who hovered over it vigilantly, or
darted this way and that to drive off the piscatorial <em>hoi
polloi</em> hanging about the neighbourhood, ready to slip in at
the first opportunity and eat the eggs. Just to see what would
happen, I put my hand down into the water and moved it slowly
toward one of the nests. To my surprise, the guardian of the nest,
instead of fleeing in alarm, proceeded to show fight. It chased my
hand away time after time, and when the hand was not removed it
would nip it vigorously, not once simply, but two or three times if
necessary, and each time with increasing energy. It contended with
the courage of a little hero. I pushed it and jostled it about, and
even took it in my hand and lifted it clear out of the water. To my
amazement, on getting back into the water, it returned promptly to
the attack. It fought until it was really fagged, for its onsets
were at last much feebler than at first. I came away after twenty
minutes, leaving the little hero in triumphant possession of his
charge.</p>
<p>Among some species of monkeys several individuals will join
together in overturning a stone for the possible ants’ eggs under
it; and, when a burying beetle has found a dead mouse or bird, it
goes and gets its companions to help it in the
interment.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter4-footnote3" id=
"part2-chapter4-ref3a" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref3a">[3a]</a></small></sup> Crows show
benevolence by feeding their blind and helpless companions, and
monkeys adopt the orphans of deceased members of their tribe. Brehm
saw two crows feeding in a hollow tree a third crow which was
wounded. They had evidently been doing this for some time, for the
wound was several weeks old. Darwin tells of a blind pelican which
was fed upon fishes, which were brought to it by its friends from a
distance of thirty miles.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote4" id="part2-chapter4-ref4a" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref4a">[4a]</a></small></sup> The devotion of
cedar-birds to each other and their kindness to all birds in
distress are well known to every student of ornithology. Olive
Thorne Miller tells of a cedar-bird that raised a brood of young
robins that had been left orphans by the accidental killing of the
parents. Weddell saw more than once during his journey to Bolivia
that when a herd of vicunas were closely pursued the strong males
covered the retreat of the weaker and less swift members of the
herd by lagging behind and protecting them.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote3" id="part2-chapter4-ref3b" name=

<p>A remarkable instance of altruism which he once saw exhibited by
the king-crabs in a London aquarium is mentioned by Kropotkin in
his work on ‘Mutual Aid a Factor in Evolution.’ One of these crabs
had fallen on its back in a corner of the tank. And for one of
these great creatures, with its saucepan carapace, to get on its
back is, even in favourable circumstances, a serious matter. The
seriousness was increased in this instance by an iron bar, which
hindered the normal activities of the unfortunate crustacean. ‘Its
comrades came to the rescue, and for one hour’s time I watched how
they endeavoured to help their fellow-prisoner. They came two at
once, pushed their friend from beneath, and after strenuous efforts
succeeded in lifting it upright. But then the iron bar prevented
them from achieving the work of rescue, and the crab again fell
heavily on its back. After many attempts, one of the helpers went
into the depth of the tank and brought two other crabs, who began
with fresh forces the same pushing and lifting of their helpless
comrade. We stayed in the aquarium for more than two hours, and,
when leaving, came to cast a glance upon the tank. The work of
attempted rescue still continued. Since I saw that I cannot refuse
credit to the observation quoted by Dr. Erasmus Darwin that the
common crab during the moulting season stations a sentinel, an
unmolted or hard-shelled individual, to prevent marine enemies from
injuring moulted individuals in their unprotected state.’ Walruses
go to the defence of a wounded comrade when summoned by its cries
for help. Romanes tells of a gander who acted as a guardian to his
blind consort, taking her neck gently in his mouth and leading her
to the water when she wanted to take a swim, and after allowing her
to cruise for a time under his guidance and care, conducting her
back home again in the same thoughtful manner. When goslings were
hatched, this remarkable gander seemed to realise the inability of
the mother to look after them, for he took charge of them as if
they were his own, convoying them to the waterside, and lifting
them carefully out of the ruts and pits with his bill whenever they
got into difficulty.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter4-footnote1"

"part2-chapter4-ref1b">[1b]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The disposition to go to the aid of a fellow in trouble is one
of the most characteristic traits in the psychology of the swine. A
single squeal of distress from even the scrawniest member of a
swine herd will bring down on the one who causes this distress the
hair-raising wrath of every porker within hearing. This trait has
been considerably reduced by domestication, and in those varieties
in which degeneracy has gone farthest it scarcely exists. But it is
exceedingly strong in all wild hogs. Animals as low in the scale of
development and as proverbially cold as snakes have been known,
when educated and treated with kindness, to manifest considerable
affection for their friends and masters. Nearly all domestic
animals display a good deal of affection, not only to their young,
but to adult members of their own kind and to their human masters.
The devotion of the dog to man is without a parallel anywhere. It
has been said that ‘the dog is the only thing on this earth that
loves you more than he loves himself.’ When dogs become so much
attached to their masters or mistresses that they pine and die on
being separated from them, they show beyond any question that they
have feelings which, in intensity, are not inferior to those
possessed by the more highly developed men and women. And this has
happened time after time.</p>
<p>A pathetic story of love and of its tragic close came last year
out of the Maine woods. Two moose, who had been tracked all day by
a couple of human tigers, were finally overtaken, when one of them
fell pierced by two rifle-balls. The remaining moose, instead of
dashing off into the forest, stood still, lowered its head, and
sniffed at its fallen companion. Then, raising its antlers high
into the air, it bellowed loudly. As the cry of the great creature
echoed through the forest, it also fell at the discharge of the
rifles. It was found on examination afterwards that the first moose
was blind, and that the second one, which had neglected to leave it
for safety, was its pilot.</p>
<p>My father once owned a cow who contracted a strong affection for
my sister. This cow, who showed on many occasions and in many ways
her highly developed emotional nature, would scarcely allow anyone
else than my sister to milk her. She always presented herself to my
sister as soon as she was let into the lot in order to be milked
first, and she was so jealous of this privilege that if it were not
accorded to her she would stand with her head down and give vent to
her unhappiness in low moans. After she was milked she would follow
her human friend around from one cow to another, in order to be as
near her as possible. She knew my sister’s voice from that of
everyone else, and would always low a response and come to her when
called by name, even though she were a quarter of a mile away in
the pasture. Romanes tells somewhere of a band of apes that were
being pursued by dogs when a young ape was cut off from the rest
and was about to be killed by the dogs. The chief of the band,
seeing the peril of the young one, went deliberately back and
rescued it.</p>
<p>Many animals show that they possess a rudimentary sense of
humour by the pranks and tricks which they play on each other and
on human beings. The monkey is the prince of nonhuman jokers, but
dogs, cats, horses, elephants, and other animals have enough of
this sense to have books written about it. A monkey has been
observed to slyly pass his hand back of a second monkey and tweak
the tail of a third one, and then composedly enjoy himself while
the resentment of the injured monkey expended itself on the
innocent middle one. Many monkeys enjoy entertaining their friends
with grimaces, by carrying a cane, putting a tin dish on their
heads, or other droll antics. These intelligent animals have a
sufficiently high appreciation of the ludicrous to dislike
ridicule. Like human beings, they can’t endure being laughed at,
and get mad if they are made the victims of a joke. Romanes’ monkey
was one day asked to crack a nut for the amusement of a visitor.
The nut turned out to be a bad one, and the melancholy look of
disappointment on the monkey’s face caused the visitor to laugh.
The insulted monkey flew into a rage, and hurled the nut at the
offending scoffer, then the hammer, and finally the coffee-pot
which simmered on the grate fire.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote1" id="part2-chapter4-ref1c" name=

baboon in the Zoological Gardens of London who always became
infuriated every time his keeper took out a letter or book and read
aloud to him. On one occasion when Darwin was present the baboon
became so furious that he bit his own leg until it
bled.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter4-footnote4" id=

<p>The emotion variously known as shame, regret, repentance, and
remorse, is not common among the non-human races. It is found
sometimes in dogs and monkeys, and especially in educated
anthropoids. But this emotion is exceedingly rare among savages,
and is not at all universal even among civilised societies of men.
Some animals manifest self-restraint, which is an exceedingly elite
quality of mind, and one not so common as it might be even among
the higher breeds of mankind. By restraint is meant the inhibition
of a desire or instinct in the presence of circumstances tending to
render the desire or instinct active—and this is obedience, and the
beginning of morality. A dog that will not chase a hare in the
presence of his master may do so in his absence. I taught my
guinea-pigs to abstain from certain food in their presence which
they wanted very much, and which they would have eaten if they had
not been educated to let it alone. Sympathy is the most beautiful
of all terrestrial emotions. It is manifested, sometimes to an
exceedingly touching degree, by all the highest races of animals.
No other instances than those already given can be mentioned here.
It is sufficient to say that the difference between the
savage—whose sympathies are so feeble that he has been known to
knock his own child’s brains out for dropping a basket, and who
puts his aged parents to death in order to avoid the burden of
maintaining them, and whose sympathies seldom extend beyond his
family or tribe—and civilised men and women, who feel actual pain
when in the presence of those who suffer, and whose sympathies
sometimes include all sentient creation, is much greater than that
between the savage and many nonhuman animals. The frail, narrow,
fantastic character of human sympathy is the most mournful fact in
human nature. ‘Man’s inhumanity to man makes countless thousands
mourn,’ and his inhumanity to not-men makes the planet a ball of
pain and terror.</p>
<p><em>Volition</em> is the power of the mind to act executively.
Or, perhaps, it is the resultant of the impulses actuating a mind
at any particular instant. Whatever volition is, it is the same
thing in the insect as in the man. Non-human beings have been
observed to pause and deliberate and to make wise and momentous
decisions in the twinkling of an eye. A chased hare will decide to
squat, to go straight ahead, or to do something else which the
emergency demands, just as unmistakably as a human fugitive. In the
sense of being the power to act differently from the manner in
which a being actually does act, there is no such thing as
freewill. The will of the worm is just as free as the will of the
judge—not in the sense that it is as varied in the directions of
its activity, but in the sense that the character of its activities
is determined inevitably by the character of its antecedents. All
will, whether human or non-human, invariably acts in the direction
of the strongest motive, just as a stone or a river invariably
moves, if it moves at all, in the direction of the strongest
tendency or force. It is impossible that this should be otherwise.
For, if the will in any case elects to overthrow this fact by
arbitrarily discarding a stronger motive for a feebler, in the very
motive of the election are concealed elements which transform the
feebler motive into the stronger. All motion, voluntary and
involuntary—the motion of bullets, beings, societies, and
suns—takes place along the lines of least arrest. Every being is
compelled to decide as he does decide and to act as he does act by
the inherited tendencies of his own nature and the tendencies of
the environment in which he exists. And if any being, after having
passed through life, were again placed back at the beginning of
life and endowed with the same nature as before, and were acted
upon through life by surroundings identical with those he had
previously met, he would act—that is, he would exercise his will—in
precisely the same way in every particular as he had previously
done. To deny these things is to assert that the conduct of living
beings is without law, and that psychology and sociology are not
sciences.</p>
<p>Non-human beings, all of the higher ones, have the same brain
and nervous apparatus as man, and in their involuntary phenomena
they closely resemble human beings. Aim a pretended blow near the
eyes of a dog or a horse and it will wink involuntarily, just as a
human being does. Sever the spinal cord of a man or a frog, and
irritate the feet of each, and they will each manifest the same
phenomena of reflex action, drawing their feet away each time from
the stimulus.</p>
<p><em>Instinct</em> and <em>reason</em> are forms of intelligence.
Intelligence is the adaptation of acts to ends. Intelligence is
manifested by all organisms, both plants and animals, and may be
either conscious or unconscious. Plant intelligence and reflex
action are forms of <em>unconscious</em> intelligence. Plant
intelligence, or the adaptation of acts to ends by plants, is
manifested by plants in the shifting of their positions when in
need of light in order to obtain as large a supply as possible of
the essential sunshine; in devices, such as traps and flowers, for
utilising the juices and services of insects; in germinating and
growing away from, instead of toward, the centre of the earth; in
discriminating between this and that kind of food; and in a
thousand other ways. Plant intelligence is all explicable in terms
of chemistry and physics, and is, so far as is known, unaccompanied
by consciousness. Reflex action is chemical affinity aided by the
co-ordinating powers of nerve tissue. The vital processes of all
animals, from the lowest to the highest, and many other highly
habitual and highly essential operations, are carried on by reflex
action. Reflex action in animals, like plant intelligence, is
unconscious.</p>
<p>Instinct and reason are <em>conscious</em>. Instinct is
inherited intelligence—intelligence manifested independently of,
and prior to, experience and instruction. ‘Instinct,’ says Romanes,
‘is reflex action into which has been imported the element of
consciousness’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter4-footnote5" id=
"part2-chapter4-ref5a" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref5a">[5a]</a></small></sup> It is exhibited by
the babe when it nurses the mother’s breast; by the chick when it
pecks its way out through the shell of the egg; by animals
generally, including man, in their solicitude for their young; by
the parent bird in incubation; and by all beings when they seek
food in obedience to the impulse of hunger. Our conception of the
mental processes of non-humans is as yet very primitive, owing to
our limited means of information and the erroneous influence on our
judgments of traditional ways of thinking; and much that is
attributed by us to instinct is not instinct at all, but is
acquired by the young through education imparted by the elders.
Parent birds have often been seen teaching their young ones to fly,
and no doubt a good deal of the migratory acumen manifested by
birds is nothing but custom and tradition handed down to each
younger generation by the old and experienced. A large part of the
knowledge of mankind (or what passes for knowledge) consists of
habits and hobbies, customs and traditions, impressed upon each new
generation by the generation which produced it. Each generation of
men seems to feel that whenever it creates a new generation it has
got to pile on to this new generation all of the fool notions which
have been acquired from the past, amplified by its own inventions.
And when we come to know other animals better, there is practically
no doubt that we shall find that a large part of what we now call
instinct and look upon as congenital will, on closer and more
rational examination, be found to be nothing but the pedagogical
effects of early environment. Professor Poulton, of Oxford, who has
made many experiments on just-born birds, says that young chicks
learn to fear the hawk and to interpret the oral warnings of the
mother. Cats teach their young to play with their prey in that
cruel manner so characteristic of all the Felidae, as I have myself
observed more than once. A mother cat will carry a live mouse into
the presence of her kittens and lie down and play with it, tossing
it playfully into the air, poking it with her paw when it does not
move, and arresting it when it starts to run away, the kittens all
the time looking on, but never once attempting to take the mouse.
After awhile the mother hands the captive over to the kittens, who
go through the same performance one after another. After they have
practised on it until the unfortunate creature is almost dead, the
old cat will probably walk over to where the mouse is and eat it
up. The whole thing is a <em>school</em>. The mouse is obviously
not intended as food for the young, but to be used simply to impart
instruction to them.</p>
<p>‘In popular writings and lectures some or all of the following
activities of ant-life are commonly ascribed to instinct: The
recognition of members of the same nest; powers of communication;
keeping aphides for the sake of their sweet secretions; collection
of aphid eggs in October, hatching them out in the nest, and taking
them in the spring to the daisies on which they feed, for pasture;
slave-making and slave-keeping, which, in some cases, is so ancient
a habit that the enslavers are unable even to feed themselves;
keeping insects as beasts of burden—<em>e.g.</em> a kind of
plant-bug to carry leaves; keeping beetles, etc., as domestic pets;
habits of personal cleanliness—one ant giving another a brush-up,
and being, brushed up in return; habits of play and recreation;
habits of burying their dead; the storage of grain and nipping the
budding rootlet to prevent further germination; the habit of Texan
ants of preparing a clearing around their nest, and, six months
later, harvesting the ant-rice—a kind of grass of which they are
particularly fond—even seeking and sowing the grain which shall
yield the harvest; the collection by other ants of grass to manure
the soil, on which there grows a species of fungus upon which they
feed; the military organisation of the ecitons of Central America;
and so forth. But to class all of these activities of the ant as
illustrations of instinct is a survival of an old-fashioned method
of treatment.</p>
<p>‘Suppose that the intelligent ant were to make observations on
human behaviour as displayed in one of our great cities or in an
agricultural district. Seeing so great an amount of routine work
going on around him, might he not be in danger of regarding all
this as evidence of hereditary instinct? Might he not find it
difficult to obtain satisfactory evidence of the fact that this
routine work has to some extent to be learned? Might he not say
(perhaps not wholly without truth), “I can see nothing whatever in
the training of these beings to fit them for their life-work. The
training of their children has no more apparent bearing upon the
activities of their after-life than the feeding of our grubs has on
the duties of ant-life. They seem to fall into the routine of life
with little or no preparatory training as the periods for the
manifestation of the various instincts arrive. If learning thereof
there be, it has so far escaped our observation. And such
intelligence as their activities evince (and many of them do show
remarkable adaptations to uniform conditions of life) would seem to
be rather ancestral than of the present time, as is shown by the
fact that many of the adaptations are directed rather to past
conditions of life than to those which now hold good. In the
presence of new emergencies to which their instincts have not
fitted them, these poor creatures are often completely at a loss.
We cannot but conclude, therefore, that, although acting under
somewhat different and less favourable conditions, instinct
occupies fully as large a space in the psychology of man as it does
in that of the ant, while human intelligence is far less unerring
and hence markedly inferior to our own.”</p>
<p>‘Are these views much more absurd than the views of those who,
on the evidence which we at present possess, attribute all the
activities of ant-life to instinct?’<sup><small><a href=

<p><em>Reason</em> is the power of adapting means to ends which is
acquired from experience or instruction. All animals that profit by
experience, therefore, or that learn from instruction—that is, are
teachable—exercise reason.</p>
<p>The line of demarkation between instinct and reason is a
mezzotint, reason being often instinctive, and instinct being as
frequently flavoured with judgment, ‘Instinct is usually regarded
as a special property of the lower animals, and contrasted with the
conscious reason of man. But just as reason may be looked upon as a
higher form of the understanding or intellect, and not as something
essentially distinct from them, so a closer examination shows that
instinct and the conscious understanding do not stand in absolute
contrast, but rather in a complex relation, and cannot be sharply
marked off from each other.’ It is instinct that urges the bird to
build its nest; but when birds whose habit it is to build on the
ground learn, on the introduction of cats into the neighbourhood,
to change their nesting-places to the tree-tops, intelligence and
thought are necessary. The first time Cavy (one of my guinea-pigs)
smelled a cat, she was almost scared to death. She jumped back from
it as if she had come in contact with a red-hot stove, and screamed
and kept on screaming, and shot down under my coat as if she were
about to be crucified. After a little while I tried to pull her
out, but she refused, and kept hiding. The second time the kitten
was presented to her the result was the same. But after two or
three days of association, she paid little more attention to it
than to the other guinea-pigs. She had never seen a cat before.
<em>It was the odour of the carnivore</em> that terrified her, and
the effect was purely instinctive. But instinct was soon modified
by intelligent experience. (<em>Poor dear little Cavy! I wonder
where she is now!</em>)</p>
<p>Both instinct and reason (and one, too, just as much as the
other) are absolutely dependent upon processes that are purely
mechanical—that is, upon brain processes; and brain processes
depend upon brain structure, which is inherited. Hence, reason is,
in a certain sense, as truly inherited as instinct is. A being must
be born with the particular nervous apparatus by means of which
reasoning is carried on, or with the power or disposition to
develop this apparatus, or he will never reason. The genius of the
partridge in cajoling the passer-by from her nest is called
instinct, but it is not more inherited than was the genius of
Shakspere. Experience simply calls into being that, whatever it is
in each particular being, which is inherited. Sir Isaac Newton took
to philosophy and Ole Bull to music not less inevitably than the
duck takes to water or the hound to hunting. Reason is, hence,
inherited by every man, who has it as truly as his erect posture
and plantigrade feet. There is something in the past of all of us
and of everything which has determined, and which may be used to
account for, everything that to-day exists or happens, even to the
style and behaviour of every leaf that flutters in the forest, and
to the eccentricities of our opinions and handwritings.</p>
<p>Reason, in the sense in which it is here used, is found feebly
in the oyster. Oysters taken from a depth never uncovered by the
sea open their shells, lose their water, and quickly perish. But
oysters taken from the same depths, if kept where they are
occasionally left uncovered for short intervals, learn to keep
their shells closed and to live a much longer period out of the
water. On the coast of France ‘oyster schools’ exist, where oysters
intended for inland cities are educated to keep their shells closed
when out of the water in order to enable them to survive the
desiccating exposures of the overland journey.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote1" id="part2-chapter4-ref1d" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref1d">[1d]</a></small></sup> This act of the
bivalve is probably the result of something like a vague form of
reason. It is an act adapted to the accomplishment of a definite
end, and the adapting power is acquired from experience. It is,
moreover, reason which in its final analysis does not differ from
the reason displayed by the wisest being that thinks. Judgment,
forethought, common-sense, inference, ingenuity, genius, reason,
and abstract thought, are all exercises of the cognitive or
perceptive power of mind, and consist, all of them, in nothing more
nor less than the discerning of relations among stimuli. The dog
who adopts a cut-off in order to intercept a fleeing hare performs
exactly the same kind of intellectual process as the mechanic who
erects a windmill in order to divert the energies of the breeze, or
the politician who adopts a particular platform to catch votes. ‘A
perception is always in its essential nature what logicians term a
<em>conclusion</em>, whether it has reference to the simplest
memory of the past sensation or to the highest product of abstract
thought. For, when the highest product of abstract thought is
analysed, the ultimate elements must always be found to consist in
material given directly by the senses; and every stage in the
symbolic construction of ideas, in which the process of abstraction
consists, depends on acts of perception taking place in the lower
stages’.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter4-footnote5" id=
"part2-chapter4-ref5b" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref5b">[5b]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The difference among the perceptive acts of different
individuals consists, not in the different kinds of intellectual
exercise, but in differences among the <em>materials</em> with
which the perceptive faculty deals. There are perceptions of simple
sensations, and there are perceptions of composite sensations, or
concepts—perceptions of elementary relations, and perceptions of
compound and elaborate relations. But all displays of rational
faculty, from the simple judgment of distance by the dimness and
distinctness of definition and the size of the visual angle, which
all higher animals are compelled to make, to the labyrinthic
abstractions of the logician, consist in nothing in addition to
discriminations among stimuli.</p>
<p>Brehm one day gave one of his apes a paper bag with a lump of
sugar and a wasp in it. The ape in getting the sugar was stung by
the wasp. From that day, whenever Brehm gave that ape, or any other
ape in that cage, a paper package, the animal, before opening it,
took the precaution to shake the package at his ear and listen to
find out whether or not there was a wasp
inside.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter4-footnote7" id=
"part2-chapter4-ref7" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref7">[7]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>Now, such an act of intelligence implies several inferences. A
train of thoughts something like this must have passed through this
ape’s mind: ‘Now, if one wasp can sting, so can another; and, if a
man can deceive me once by wrapping a wasp in a paper with a lump
of sugar, he may try it again; and, if one man will attempt such a
thing, so may another; and, if men will attempt it on me, they may
attempt it on my friends; so I will warn my friends to look out for
those villainous chaps outside.’ These inferences of the ape are
the same kind of generalisations exactly as are made by men
everywhere in their daily lives. And the common-sense inferences
made by ordinary people in their every-day affairs are precisely
the same processes of reasoning as those used by scientists and
philosophers. Many people, like the character in Moliere’s plays
who was surprised and delighted to learn that he had been talking
prose all his life, are surprised on hearing for the first time
that they use <em>induction</em> and <em>deduction</em> every hour
almost of their waking lives. They imagine that philosophers must
have some secret and superior way of acquiring their conclusions,
different from what ordinary mortals have. ‘But there is no more
difference,’ says Huxley, ‘between the mental operations of a man
of science and those of an ordinary person than there is between
the operations and methods of a grocer weighing out his goods in
common scales and the operations of a chemist in performing a
difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely
graduated weights. It is not that the scales in the one case and
the balances in the other differ in the principles of their
construction or manner of working; but the beam of the one is set
on an infinitely finer axis than the other, and, of course, turns
by the addition of a much smaller weight’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote8" id="part2-chapter4-ref8" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref8">[8]</a></small></sup> And the difference in
mental method between the man of learning and the ordinary man or
woman is the same as the difference between mature men and children
and between men generally and other animals. It is one of
<em>degree</em>, <em>not</em> of <em>kind</em>. The philosopher,
the clodhopper, and the ape, all use precisely the same methods of
reasoning, differing only in exactness and in the materials of
consciousness dealt with.</p>
<p>Nearly all animals, from mollusks to men, reason—not once or
twice in a lifetime, but the most of them every day and every hour
of their existence. In fact, it would be impossible for any animal
addicted to moving about, and with a delicate and easily wrecked
organism, to long survive in a world like this without that
elasticity of action which reason alone can impart. Since they live
in the same world-conditions as human beings, and are seeking
providence for substantially the same wants, non-human beings
manifest reason in the same general directions as human beings
do—in the location and construction of their homes and fortresses,
in the arrest of their prey, in circumventing their enemies, in
overcoming obstacles and surmounting dangers, in protecting and
educating their young, in meeting the emergencies of food and
climate, in the wooing of mates and the waging of wars, and in the
thousand other cases where they are called upon in their daily
wanderings and doings to deal with novel and unprecedented
situations.</p>
<p>When wild geese are feeding there is said to be always one of
them that acts as sentinel. This one never takes a grain of corn
while on duty. When it has acted awhile it gives the bird next to
it a sharp peck and utters a querulous kind of cry, and the second
one takes its turn. This is prudence, or forethought, which is a
form of reason. When swans are diving there is generally one that
stays above the water and watches. Sentinels have alarm sounds of
various kinds, which they give to signify ‘enemy.’ ‘Ibex, marmots,
and mountain-sheep whistle; prariedogs bark; elephants trumpet;
wild geese and swans have a kind of bugle call; rabbits and sheep
stamp on the ground; crows caw: and wild ducks utter a low, warning
quack.’</p>
<p>In the <em>Popular Science Monthly</em> for March, 1901, is an
account of a series of experiments on the intelligence of the
turtle made by Professor Yerkes, of Harvard. The turtle was placed
in a labyrinth, at the farther end of which was a comfortable bed
of sand. It took just thirty-five minutes of wandering for the
turtle to reach the nest the first time. But in the second trial
the nest was reached in fifteen minutes, and by the tenth trip the
turtle was familiar enough with the route to go through in three
and one-half minutes, making but two mistakes. The turtle was
afterwards placed in a more complex labyrinth, containing, among
other features, a blind alley and two inclines. The inclines were
puzzles, and it took one hour and thirty-five minutes of aimless
rambling for the wanderer to reach its nest the first time. But the
fifth trip was made in sixteen minutes, and the tenth in four
minutes, which was not far from direct.</p>
<p>These experiments show that animals of almost proverbial density
may learn with surprising quickness. English sparrows and other
avian inhabitants of the city learn to live tranquilly along the
busiest thoroughfares, exposed to all sorts of dangers, and
subjected to what would be to many birds the most terrifying
circumstances. Whizzing trolleys, tramping multitudes, and
screaming engines have no terrors for them. They simply exercise
the caution necessary to keep from being run over. They boldly
build their nests right under passing elevated cars, where the roar
is sufficient to scare the life out of an ordinary country bird. I
have seen these testy little chaps sit and feed and jabber to each
other in a perfectly unconcerned way within ten or fifteen feet of
a thundering express train. They do not do these things from
instinct: they <em>learn</em> to do them. They know that a
diabolical-looking locomotive is harmless, because they have seen
it before; and they know that an insignificant urchin with a savage
heart and a sling is not harmless, and they know it simply because
they have previously had dealings with him. English sparrows will
disappear completely from a neighborhood if a few of them are
killed. Cats, dogs, horses—all animals, in fact—acquire during life
a fund of information as to how to act in order to avoid harm and
extinction. If they did not, they would not live long. And they do
it just as man does it, by memory and discrimination, by retaining
impressions made upon them, and acting differently when an
impression is made a second, third, or thirteenth time.</p>
<p>Animals of experience (including men) are more skilful in
adjusting themselves to environmental exigencies than the young and
inexperienced, because of their store of initial impressions. It is
a matter of common observation that young animals are more easily
caught or killed or otherwise victimised than the old and
experienced. Many animals, however, (and a good many men) are able
to profit by a single impression. One dose of tartar emetic is
generally sufficient to cure an egg-sucking dog, and it is a very
stupid canine indeed that does not understand perfectly after one
or two experiences with a porcupine or an unsavory skunk. ‘The
burnt child dreads the fire,’ but so does the burnt puppy. Rengger
states that his Paraguay monkeys, after cutting themselves only
once with any sharp tool, would not touch it again, or would handle
it with the greatest caution.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote1" id="part2-chapter4-ref1e" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref1e">[1e]</a></small></sup> Older trout are more
wary than young ones, and fishes that have been much hunted and
deceived become suspicious of traps. Rats, martins, and other
animals cannot long be trapped in the same way, and partridges and
other birds seldom fly against telegraph-wires the second season
after the wires are put up. These animals, however, cannot learn to
avoid these dangers from experience, for only a few of them are
ever caught or struck. They must learn it from observing their
unfortunate companions. Everyone who has read the story of Lobo,
the big gray wolf of the Carrumpaw, cannot but wonder at the
remarkable shrewdness shown by this old leader in baffling for
years the tigers that hung upon his tracks.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote9" id="part2-chapter4-ref9" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref9">[9]</a></small></sup> Nansen states that the
seals, before man invaded the Arctics, occupied the inner ice-floes
to avoid the polar bear, but after man came they took to living on
the outer floes in order to escape the persecutions of this new and
more fearful enemy. Domestic animals, when first turned out in new
regions, often die from eating poisonous weeds, but in some way
soon learn to avoid them. Many animals, when pursuing other
animals, or when being pursued, display a knowledge of facts very
little understood by the majority of mankind, such as of places
where scent lies or is obliterated, and the effects of wind in
carrying evidence of their presence to their enemies. The hunted
roebuck or hare will make circles, double on its own tracks, take
to water, and fling itself for considerable distances through the
air as cleverly as if it had read up all the theory of scent in a
book. According to the London <em>Spectator</em> one of the large
African elephants in the Zoological Gardens of that city restores
to its entertainers all the bits of food which on being thrown to
him fall alike out of his reach and theirs. He points his proboscis
straight at the food, and blows it along the floor to the feet of
those who have thrown it. He clearly knows what he is about, for if
he does not blow hard enough to land the food the first time, he
blows harder and harder until he does. The cacadoos (parrots) of
Australia, before descending upon a field or orchard in search of
food, send out a scouting party to reconnoitre the region and see
that ‘all is well.’ Sometimes a second party is sent. If the report
is favourable, the whole band advance and plunder the field in
short order. These birds are exceedingly wary and intelligent, and
seldom make mistakes. But ‘if man once succeeds in killing one of
them, they become so prudent and watchful that they henceforward
baffle all stratagems’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter4-footnote3" id="part2-chapter4-ref3c" name=
"part2-chapter4-ref3c">[3c]</a></small></sup> A short time ago a
parrot at Washington, New Jersey, saved the life of its owner by
summoning the neighbours to his relief. Cries of ‘Murder!’ ‘Help!’
‘Come quick!’ coming from the home of the parrot, attracted the
attention of neighbours, who ran to the house to find out the
cause. ‘They found the owner of the parrot lying on the floor
unconscious, bleeding from a great gash in his neck. He had been
repairing the ceiling, and had fallen and struck his head against
the stove. It required six stitches to close the wound, and the
surgeon said that in only a few minutes the injured man would have
been dead. A few years ago this parrot’s screams awakened its owner
in time to arouse his neighbours and save them from a fire which
started in the house next door.’</p>
<p>A friend of mine, who is thoroughly reliable, tells me that when
he was a student at the University of Michigan a few years ago one
of the professors of zoology there had a dog who was used by the
department for experiments in digestion. The dog was compelled to
wear a tube opening downward out of his stomach, and soon grew very
weak and emaciated from the constant loss of food, which leaked out
through this tube. After a time, however, the dog was observed to
be growing unaccountably hale and strong. He was watched, and the
poor creature was found to have struck upon an ingenious expedient
to save his life. On eating his meal, he would go out to the barn,
and, in order to prevent the artificial escape of the contents of
his stomach, would lie down flat on his back between two boxes and
remain there until his digested food had passed safely beyond the
pylorus.</p>
<p>A few months ago, John, one of the monkeys at Lincoln Park,
Chicago, was suffering from a terrible abscess on the cheek, and an
operation became necessary in order to save the little fellow’s
life. It was a pathetic sight to see the look of trust in the
monkey’s eyes when the surgeon was ready to begin the operation,
and the courage and fortitude displayed by the sufferer were almost
human. At the first touch of the knife the monkey pressed his head
hard against the knee of the assistant and grabbed the forefinger
of each of the assistant’s hands, just as a person does who is
about to undergo a painful operation. The swelling was first cut
open and washed with antiseptic, when the cheek-bone was scraped
and a small piece of it removed. After being again washed in
antiseptic, the wound was sewed up, and John was lifted gently back
into his cage—not, however, until he had licked the hands of the
surgeon and kissed his face in gratitude. The little hero never
uttered a sound from the time the knife first touched his face
until he was put back into his cage. A similar act of intelligence
is recorded of an orang. Having been once bled on account of
illness, and not feeling well some time afterward, this orang went
from one person to another, and, pointing to the vein in his arm,
signified his desire to have the operation repeated. Both of these
instances are examples of reason of a very high order—of a higher
order, indeed, than many children and some grown people exhibit in
similar circumstances. The chimpanzee, Mafuca, learned how to
unlock her cage, and stole the key and hid it under her arm for
future use. After watching the carpenter boring holes with his
brad-awl, she took the brad-awl and bored holes in her table. She
poured out milk for herself at meals, and always carefully stopped
pouring before the cup ran over.</p>
<p>When baboons go on marauding expeditions, they show that they
realise perfectly what they are doing by moving with great stealth.
Not a sound is uttered. If any thoughtless youngster so far forgets
the necessities of the occasion as to utter a single chatter, he is
given a reminder in the shape of a box on the ear. ‘A certain Mr.
Cops, who had a young orang, gave it half an orange one day, and
put the other half away out of its sight on a high press, and lay
down himself on the sofa. But the ape’s movements, attracting his
attention, he only pretended to go to sleep. The creature came
cautiously and satisfied himself that his master was asleep, then
climbed up the press, ate the rest of the orange, carefully hid the
peel among the shavings in the grate, examined the pretended
sleeper again, and then went and lay down on his own bed.’ This
incident is recorded by Tylor in his ‘Anthropology.’ ‘And such
behaviour,’ he adds, ‘is to be explained only by supposing a train
of thought to pass through the brain of the ape somewhat similar to
what we ourselves call reason.’ These instances of undoubted
intelligence and thought might be added to almost without number if
there was room. Every person nearly who has been in the world any
length of time, and has had occasion to associate with these
so-called ‘machines,’ has seen for himself, often unexpectedly,
many flashes of brightness among them.</p>
<p>It has been said that man differs from other animals, and is
superior to them in the fact that he modifies his environment while
other animals do not, but are modified by environment. Mr. Lester
F. Ward makes this distinction in his ‘Pure Sociology.’ The
distinction is no nearer the truth than other distinctions of like
character that have from time to time been drawn between men and
other animals. It is not much more than half true, if it is that,
and does not by any means deserve the italics awarded to it by this
writer. Many races of non-human beings have a far greater influence
on their environment than many races of men have. Many tribes of
men wander about naked, build no habitations, make no weapons, and
feed upon the fruits, roots, insects, and such other chance morsels
as they can pick up from day to day in their wanderings. Such races
are far inferior in constructive activity to the birds, who build
elaborate houses, and to the beavers, who not only construct
substantial dwellings, but dam rivers, and cut down trees and
transport them long distances, and dig artificial waterways, to be
used as aids in their engineering enterprises. Compare the
elaborate compartments of the Australian bower-birds, surrounded
with ornamented and carefully-kept grounds, with the lean-to of
many savage tribes, made by sticking two or three palm-leaves in
the ground and leaning them against a pole. Even ants plant crops,
make clearings, build roads and tunnels, etc. It must be
remembered, too, that, however affirmative and masterful a race of
men may become, it never succeeds, and never can succeed, in
emancipating itself from the influences of environment. It is true
that with the growth of intelligence among organic forms there has
been a constant transfer of influence from the environment to the
organism; but this transfer began, not with man by any means, but
low down in the scale of animal life.</p>
<p>It has been said that man is the only animal that uses tools.
But this is not true either, for animals as low in the scale of
development as insects have been known to use tools. At least two
different observers testify to having seen ground-wasps use small
stones as hammers in packing the dirt firmly over their nests.
Spiders use stones as weights to steady their webs in times of
storm. Orangs throw sticks and stones at their pursuers, and
certain tribes of Abyssinian baboons, when they go to battle with
each other, carry stones as missiles. Monkeys often use stones to
crack nuts with, and tame monkeys know very well how to use a
hammer when it is given to them. In the London Zoological Gardens a
monkey with poor teeth kept a stone hidden in the straw of its cage
to crack its nuts with, and it would not allow any other monkey to
touch the stone. ‘Here,’ says Darwin, in speaking of this case, ‘is
the idea of property.’ Monkeys also use sticks as levers in prying
open chests and lifting heavy objects. Cuvier’s orang used to carry
a chair across the room and stand on it to lift the door-latch.
Chimpanzees, who are very fond of making a noise, have been seen
standing around a hollow log in the forest, beating it with sticks;
and if we are to believe Emin Pasha, these ingenious parodies of
men sometimes carry torches when they go at night on foraging
expeditions. The Indian elephant, when travelling, will sometimes
turn aside and break off a leafy branch from a roadside tree and
carry it along in its trunk to sweep off the flies. As Dr. Wesley
Mills says in his work on ‘The Nature and Development of Animal
Intelligence,’ ‘It was formerly believed that animals cannot
reason, but only those persons who do not themselves reason about
the subject, with the facts before them, can any longer occupy such
a position.’</p>

<h3 id="part2-chapter5">V. Conclusion.</h3>
<p>It is enough. The ancient gulf scooped by human conceit between
man and the other animals has been effectually and forever filled
up. The human species constitutes but one branch in the gigantic
arbour of life. And all the merit and all the feeling and all the
righteousness of the world are not, as we have been accustomed to
aver, congested into this one branch. And all of the weakness and
deformity are not, as we have also been anxious to believe, found
elsewhere. The reluctance of wrinkles and deformities to appear in
the pictures of men, and of strength and beauty to appear in the
representations of the other races of the earth, is to be accounted
for by the highly elucidative fact that man is the universal
portrait-painter. There is no one to tell man what he is and how he
strikes others, and hence he is the ‘paragon of creation’—the
inter-stellar pet, half clay and half halo—the image and pride of
the gods—the flower and gem of the eternal spheres. Man is the only
professional linguist in the universe. And it is fortunate for him
that he is. For, if he were not, his auditories would be compelled
to carry to his perceptive centres a great many sentiments he now
never hears. He would be likely to hear a good deal said, and said
with a good deal of feeling, about perpendicular
brigand—grandiloquent kakistocrat swelling with
self-righteousness—rhetorical hideful wrapped in pillage and gorged
with decomposition—a voluble and sanctimonious squash with two
sticks in it. The definition of man as it appears in the dictionary
of the donkey probably runs something like this: ‘<em>Man</em> is
an animal that walks on its hind-legs, invents adjectives with
which to praise itself, and displays its greatest utility in
proving that all sharks are not aquatic.’ We know what a lion looks
like when painted by a man, but human eyes have never yet been
allumined by the sardonic lineaments of a man painted by a lion.
Being boiled alive in order to look well as corpses in
store-windows, and having wooden pegs thrust into our muscles and
left there to rot for a week or two to keep us in our agony from
doing something desperate—we know what these experiences are like
when they are delegated to lobsters, and we take no more serious
part in them than to insure their infliction, but we are too
fervent barbarians to bother our heads about what they are like
from the crustacean point of view.</p>
<p>Let us be candid. Men are not all gentle men and humane, and
not-men are not all inhuman. There are reptiles in broadcloth, and
there are warm and generous hearts among those peoples who have so
long suffered from human prejudice and ferocity. Let us label
beings by what they are—by the souls that are in them and the deeds
they do—not by their colour, which is pigment, nor by their
composition, which is clay. There are philanthropists in feathers
and patricians in fur, just as there are cannibals in the pulpit
and saurians among the money-changers. The golden rule may
sometimes be more religiously observed in the hearts and homes of
outcast quadrupeds than in the palatial lairs of bipeds. The horse,
who suffers and serves and starves in silence, who endures daily
wrongs of scanty and irregular meals, excessive burdens and mangled
flanks, who forgets cruelty and ingratitude, and does good to them
that spitefully use him, and submits to crime without resistance,
misunderstanding without murmur, and insult without resentment, is
a better Christian, a better exemplar of the Sermon on the Mount,
than many church-goers, in spite of the creeds and interdictions of
men. And the animal who goes to church on Sundays, wearing the
twitching skins and plundered plumage of others, and wails long
prayers and mumbles meaningless rituals, and gives unearned guineas
to the missionary, and on week-days cheats and impoverishes his
neighbours, glorifies war, and tramples under foot the most sacred
principles of morality in his treatment of his non-human kindred,
is a cold, hard-hearted <em>brute</em>, in spite of the fact that
he is cunning and vainglorious, and towers about on his
hinders.</p>
<p>There are lessons that may be learned from the uncorrupted
children of Nature—lessons in simplicity of life,
straightforwardness, humility, art, economy, brotherly love, and
cheerfulness—more beautiful, perhaps, and more true than may
sometimes be learned from the stilted and Machiavellian ways of
men. Would you learn forgiveness? Go to the dog. The dog can stand
more abuse and forgive greater accumulations of wrong than any
other animal, not even excepting a wife. About the only thing in
the universe superior to the dog in willingness to undergo outrage
is the human stomach. Would you learn wisdom and industry? Go to
the ant, that tireless toiler of the dust. The ant can do that
which no man can do—keep grain in a warm, moist atmosphere without
sprouting. Would you learn art? Go to the bee or to the wild bird’s
lodge. The art of the honeycomb and of the hang-bird’s nest
surpasses that of the cranny of the savage as the Cathedral of St.
Peter exceeds the cottage. Would you learn socialism, that dream of
poets and the hope and expectation of wise men? It is actualised
around you in thousands of insect communities. The social and
economic relations existing in the most highly wrought societies of
bees and wasps are fundamentally the ideal relations of living
beings to each other, but it will require millenniums of struggle
and bloodshed for men to come up to them. Would you learn
curiosity—not the curiosity that gossips and backbites, but the
curiosity of the explorer and searcher after knowledge? Go to the
monkey. The monkey has been known to work two hours, without pause,
utterly unconscious of everything but its purposes, trying to open
a fettered trunk lock.<sup><small><a href=
"#part2-chapter5-footnote1" id="part2-chapter5-ref1" name=
"part2-chapter5-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup> Would you learn
sobriety? Go not to the gilded hells of cities, where men die like
flies in gin’s vile miasma. Go to the spring where the antelope
drinks. Would you learn chastity? Go not to the foul dens and fiery
chambers of men. Go to the boudoir of the bower-bird, or to the
subterranean hollow where the wild wolf rears her litter.</p>
<p>Man is not the surpassingly pre-eminent individual he so
actively advertises himself to be. Indeed, in many particulars he
is excelled, and excelled seriously, by those whom he calls
‘lower.’ The locomotion of the bird is far superior in ease and
expedition to the shuffling locomotion of man. The horse has a
sense which guides it through darkness in which human eyes are
blind; and the manner in which a cat, who has been carried in a bag
and put down miles away, will turn up at the back-door of the old
home next morning dumfounds science. The eye of the vulture is a
telescope. The hound will track his master along a frequented
street an hour behind his footsteps, by the imponderable odour of
his soles. The catbird, without atlas or geographic manuals, will
find her way back over hundreds of trackless leagues, season after
season, to the same old nesting-place in the thicket. Birds,
thousands of them, journey from Mexico to Arctic America, from
Algiers and Italy to Spitzbergen, from Egypt to Siberia, and from
Australia and the Polynesian Islands to New Zealand, and build
their nests and rear their young, year after year, in the same
vale, grove, or tundra. The nightingale, who pours out his
incomparable lovesong in the twilight of English lanes during May
and June, winters in the heart of Africa; and some birds nest
within the Arctic Circle and winter in Argentina. Some of the
plovers travel the entire length of the American land mass every
summer, from Patagonia to the Arctic Circle, in order to lay three
or four pale-green eggs, and see them turn to birdlings by the
shores of the Hudson Sea. Many animals have the power to foretell
storms, and man, though he can weigh worlds, is ever glad to profit
by their superior sense. When herons fly high above the clouds,
when sea-birds dip and sport in the water and the bittern booms
from the marshes, when swallows fly low and the sow repairs her
bed, when horses scamper and cattle sniff the air, when ravens beat
the air with their wings, make noises, and flock together, when the
swan raises her eggs by additions to her nest and the prairie-dog
scratches the dirt up around its hole, when beetles are not found
in the air and caterpillars mass in their webs, when bees remain
near their hives and ants carry their eggs to their innermost
abodes, when frogs croak more loudly from their watery retreats and
fishes seek the safety of the unharried deeps—look out for foul
weather! Man has not the sweetness of the song-sparrow, the
innocence of the fawn, nor the high relative brain capacity of the
tomtit and the fice.</p>
<p>Many animals have powers by which they are able to act in
concert at times, vast numbers of them moving in unison over
immense areas by signals or intuitions which man can neither
imitate nor understand. Such are the mysterious migrations of the
Norway lemming and of many birds and insects, and such were the
memorable stampedes of the bison hordes on the American plains in
years gone by. Kropotkin saw on the Siberian steppes one autumn
‘thousands and thousands’ of fallow deer come together from an area
as large as Great Britain at a point on the Amur River in an
unprecedented exodus to the lowlands on the other
side.<sup><small><a href="#part2-chapter5-footnote2" id=
"part2-chapter5-ref2" name=
"part2-chapter5-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup> How these scattered
thousands knew when to start so as to arrive at the river at the
same time, and how they knew the direction to travel and found
their way so well, are mysteries which man can as yet only wonder
at. More marvellous yet—more marvellous, perhaps, than the
concurrent action of any other animal, for it implies the most
accurate time-keeping extending over many years—are the annual
festivals of the <em>palolo</em>, an annelid living among the
interstices of the coral reefs of some of the islands of the South
Pacific. About three o’clock on the morning following the third
quarter of the October moon, these worms invariably appear on the
surface of the sea, swarming in great numbers. Just after sunrise
their bodies begin to break to pieces, and by nine o’clock no trace
of them is left. On the morning following the third quarter of the
November moon they appear again, but usually in smaller numbers.
After that they are seen no more till the next October. This annual
swarming is a phenomenon connected with reproduction, the ova
escaping from the broken bodies of the females and, after being
fertilised by the free-floating sperms, sinking down among the
coral reefs and hatching into a new generation. ‘Year after year
these creatures appear according to lunar time. And yet in the
long-run they keep solar time. They keep two cycles, one of three
and one of twenty-nine years. In the three-year cycle there are two
intervals of twelve lunations and one of thirteen lunations. These
thirty-seven lunations bring lunar time somewhat near to solar
time. But in twenty-nine years there is enough difference to
require the addition of another lunation; the twenty-ninth year is
therefore one of thirteen instead of twelve lunations. In this way
they do not change their season in an entire century. So unfailing
is their appearance that in Samoa they have given their name to the
spring season, which is called “the time of the palolo.”’</p>
<p>Instead of the highest, man is in some respects the lowest, of
the animal kingdom. Man is the most unchaste, the most drunken, the
most selfish and conceited, the most miserly, the most
hypocritical, and the most bloodthirsty of terrestrial creatures.
Almost no animals, except man, kill for the mere sake of killing.
For one being to take the life of another for purposes of selfish
utility is bad enough. But the indiscriminate massacre of
defenceless innocents by armed and organised packs, <em>just</em>
<em>for pastime</em>, is beyond characterisation. The human species
is the only species of animals that plunges to such depths of
atrocity. Even vipers and hyenas do not exterminate for recreation.
No animal, except man, habitually seeks wealth purely out of an
insane impulse to accumulate. And no animal, except man, gloats
over accumulations that are of no possible use to him, that are an
injury and an abomination, and in whose acquisition he may have
committed irreparable crimes upon others. There are no
millionaires—no professional, legalised, lifelong
kleptomaniacs—among the birds and quadrupeds. No animal, except
man, spends so large a part of his energies striving for
superiority—not superiority in usefulness, but that superiority
which consists in simply getting on the heads of one’s fellows. And
no animal practises common, ordinary morality to the other beings
of the world in which he lives so little, compared with the amount
he preaches it, as man.</p>
<p>Let us be honest. Honour to whom honour is due. It will not
emaciate our own glory to recognise the excellence and reality of
others, or to come face to face with our own frailties. We
<em>are</em> our brother’s keeper. Our brethren are they that feel.
Let us universalise. Our thoughts and sympathies have been too long
wingless. <em>The Universe is our Country</em>, and our Kindred are
the Populations that Mount. <em>It is well</em>—it is eminently
well, for it is godlike—<em>to send our Magnanimity to the Dusts
and the Deeps</em>, <em>our Sunrises to the Uttermost Isles</em>,
<em>and our</em> <em>Charity to the Stars</em>.</p>

<p>One of the wisest things ever said by one of the profoundest
philosophers of all time was the warning to the seeker after truth
to beware of the influence of the ‘idols (or illusions) of the
tribe’ by which he meant that body of traditional prejudices which
every sect, family, nation, and neighbourhood has clinging to it,
and in the midst of which and at the mercy of which every human
being grows up.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Ethical Kinship</h2>
<h3 id="part3-chapter1">I. Human Nature a Product of the
Jungle.</h3>
<p>The Golden Rule is not exemplified by the conduct of any
considerable number of the inhabitants of the earth. To be
civilised or even half-civilised is, to the children of this world,
neither instinctive nor easy. To preserve a certain pretence or
appearance of virtue, especially when encouraged to do so by an
uplifted cudgel in the hands of the community, is a possible and
not uncommon accomplishment. But to be at heart and in reality as
considerate of others as we are of ourselves is, unfortunately, not
natural. Human beings are not children of the sun, sojourning for a
season on this spheroid of clay, and needing only pinions to be
angels. Human nature did not come, pure and shining, down from the
glittering gods. It came out of the jungle. Civilised peoples are
the not very remote posterity of savages, and savages are the
posterity of individuals who laid eggs and had literally cold blood
in their veins. Civilised men and women are troglodytes with a
veneering of virtue. In the heart of every ‘civilised’ man and
woman is an unconverted core, large or small, of barbarism.
Humanity is only a habit. Against it, and tending ever to weaken
and subvert it, are the powerful inertias of animalism. Like the
ship in Ibsen’s ‘Rhymed Epistle,’ civilisation carries a corpse in
its cargo—the elemental appetites and passions which have been
implanted in all sentient nature by the laws in accordance with
which organic forms have been fashioned. Moral progress is simply
the sloughing off of this inherited animality.</p>
<p>To the initiated, therefore, it is not strange that we civilised
folk in our conduct display so freely the phenomena of the savage.
There is nothing more inevitable in the life of the convert than
the haunting inclination to give way to original impulses. It is
not strange that we are powerless to be as good and beautiful and
true as we would like to be, that our divine efforts are our
half-hearted efforts, and that the only time we get terribly in
earnest and put forth really titanic energies is when we are
dominated directly or indirectly by the instincts of the pack.
Human aspiration is fettered by the fearful facts of human origin.
It is not strange that we are continually conscious of being torn
by contending tendencies, conscious of ghastly masteries, and of
horrible goings on in our innermost beings. The human heart is the
gladiatorial meeting-place of gods and beasts.</p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter2">II. EGOISM AND ALTRUISM.</h3>
<p>Everything has been evolved—<em>everything</em>—from daffodils
to states and from ticks to religion. Every organic thing is the
result of long and incessant survival of the
advantageous—advantageous from the standpoint of the organism
itself or from the standpoint of its kind, not necessarily so from
the standpoint of the universe. That which is true of everything is
true also of egoism and altruism. Egoism and altruism exist as
facts in the natures of human and other beings for the same reason
that the various physical facts exist in the structures of human
and other beings, because they have been advantageous in the
struggle for life. There is just as definite an explanation for the
existence of egoism and altruism in this world, and for their
existence in the particular form and ratio in which they do exist,
as there is for the fact that the human hand has five fingers, the
rose odour, and the eggs of the kildeer the mottled markings of the
clods among which they lie.</p>
<p>Egoism is preference for self, partiality toward that part of
the universe bounded by one’s own skin. It may consist simply of
regard for self, but with regard for self is usually associated
enmity toward others. Egoism manifests itself in such qualities of
mind as selfishness, cruelty, intolerance, hate, hardheartedness,
savagery, rudeness, injustice, narrowness, and the like. It is the
primal impulse of the living heart. Enmity is older and more
universal than love. Enmity constituted the very loins from which
long ago came the original miscreants of this world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I saw the fishes playing there;<br />
I saw all that was in the whole world round;<br />
In wood, and bower, and marsh, and mead, and field,<br />
All things which creep and fly, And put a foot to earth.<br />
All these I saw, and say to you,<br />
That nothing lives among them without hate.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Life has been developed through selection. This selection has
been brought about largely through war—war between individuals and
between groups of individuals. War and competition are struggle
between living beings, and the soul of competition is selfishness.
Egoism is the primal and most powerful of terrestrial impulses,
because beings hated and exterminated each other before they
tolerated and loved, and because struggle has far overshadowed
cooperation as a factor in life evolution.</p>
<p>There are those who believe that mutual aid has been a more
dynamic factor in the development of terrestrial life than
competition. Cooperation has been an important element in the
evolution of animal life, and it has operated among nearly all
animals, from the humblest to the highest. Far down near the
beginning of organic existence we find the one-celled forms
huddling together in colonies, giving rise in the course of time to
the many-celled animals. But to conclude that cooperation is the
chief factor in animal development is to shut one’s eyes to one of
the most obvious and overwhelming facts of organic evolution.
Individualism antedates mutualism, both among the one-celled forms
and among the many-celled metazoa. Cooperation everywhere is the
sequence of a long preliminary of individual contention. And
cooperation does not mean cessation of struggle, either among those
co-operating or among the groups themselves, as Kropotkin and other
exaggerators of the mutual aid factor seem to assume. It usually
does little more than transfer the struggle from individuals to
groups. When a lot of pelicans or wolves get together and work
together in order that they may thereby the better defend
themselves or slay others it is hard to see how such facts can be
placed to the credit of cooperation any more than to that of
competition. Then, too, excepting in a few societies of insects,
cooperation has not gone so far as to do more than slightly
alleviate the competition even among the members of a co-operating
group. Competition is a much more common and influential fact in
the phenomena of life than cooperation, for it involves a large
part of the activity of individual life, and is also prominent in
all social activities.</p>
<p>The preponderance of egoism in the natures of living beings is
the most mournful and immense fact in the phenomena of conscious
life. It has made the world the kind of world it would have been
had the gods actually emptied their wrath vials upon it.
Brotherhood is anomalous, and, even in its highest manifestations,
is but the expression of a veiled and calculating egoism.
Inhumanity is everywhere. The whole planet is steeped in it. Every
creature faces an inhospitable universeful, and every life is a
campaign. It has all come about as a result of the mindless and
inhuman manner in which life has been developed on the earth. It
has been said that an individual of unlimited faculties and
infinite goodness and power made this world and endowed it with
ways of acting, and that this individual, as the world’s executive,
continues to determine its phenomena by inspiring the order of its
events. But one cannot help thinking sometimes, when, in his more
daring and vivid moments, he comes to comprehend the real character
and condition of the world, what a discrepancy exists between the
reputation of this builder and his works, and cannot help wondering
whether an ordinary human being with only common-sense and insight
and an average concern for the welfare of the world would not make
a great improvement in terrestrial affairs if he only had the
opportunity for a while.</p>
<p>Altruism is the recognition of, and regard for, others. It shows
itself in feelings of justice, goodwill, tenderness, charity, pity,
public spirit, sympathy, fraternity and love, and in acts of
kindness, humanity, mercy, generosity, politeness, philanthropy and
the like. Altruism is a graft. The stock is selfishness and
brutality. Altruism (the form of altruism to which I here refer:
there are several distinct species of altruism) has come into the
world as a result of cooperation and consanguinity. It has grown
out of the cooperation of individuals in families and tribes
against their cooperating enemies. Altruism—at least, in its
initial stages—is a sort of tribal egoism. Men and other animals
have learned to stand by each other and help each other against
their common foes because it was the only way in which they were
able to stand. Those aggregates that have had strongest this
feeling of fraternity have prospered and prevailed, while the less
fraternal have gone down.</p>
<p>The altruism manifested by men in their relations with each
other is not different in kind from the altruism and cooperation
displayed by other social animals. Human gregariousness—the
gathering together of human beings into tribes and communities for
purposes of companionship and defence—is a part of the phenomena of
animal gregariousness in general. The inhabitants of a human town,
however much they may think so, are not impelled to associate with
each other and to cooperate with each other in the affairs of life
by causes or considerations different from those which actuate a
society of ants or apes, of wasps or wolves, who do the same
things. The antecedents of human ethics and society are, therefore,
to be looked for in the ant-hill and the jungle.</p>
<p>The fact that altruism has been evolved by the cooperation of
individuals <em>with each other</em> and <em>against others</em> is
a significant fact in the analysis and understanding of the ethical
phenomena of the earth. <em>To this fact is due the restricted and
illogical character of all altruism</em>. The ethical systems of
all peoples are, and have always been, to a greater or less extent,
provincial and contradictory. Ethical feeling and practice are not
extended universally—that is, to all beings—but are maintained only
among those associating more or less closely as a group, and having
interests that are more or less nearly the same. Among men of
primitive mind, morality is a thing to be practised toward only a
few thousand or even a few hundred individuals, and then in a very
half-awake and half-hearted manner. But as the perceptions sharpen
and vivify and the horizon of knowledge widens—as commerce and
imagination cause the mind to overflow the narrow bounds of the
community into larger dimensions of time and space—as the myriad
influences operating as race experience and race selection enable
men to realise the wider and wider oneness of their origin,
natures, interests, and destiny—an increasing consistency
characterises the conduct among the members of the group, and an
increasingly larger number of individuals are admitted to ethical
consideration and kinship.</p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter3">III. The Ethics of the Savage.</h3>
<p>The ethics of the savage is, almost without exception, purely
tribal in its extent. A marked distinction is everywhere made by
primitive peoples between injuries to persons <em>inside</em> the
tribe and injuries to those <em>outside</em> the tribe. Crimes
which are looked upon as felonious when committed by a savage
against the members of his own tribe may be regarded as harmless,
or even highly commendable, when perpetrated on those outside the
tribe. Acts are not judged according to their intrinsic natures or
results, but wholly as to whether they are performed on outsiders
or on insiders. The Balantis (Africa) punish with death a theft
committed against a fellow-tribesman, but encourage and reward
thieving from other tribes. The Afridi (Afghanistan) mother prays
that her son may be a successful robber—not a robber of her own
people, but of other peoples—and in order that he may become
proficient in crime teaches him to creep stealthily through a hole
in the wall. By certain Bedouin tribes the ‘strenuous life’ is held
in such high honour that ‘it is considered a disgrace to die in
bed’; and among the man-eating Fijians ‘men who have not slain an
enemy suffer the most degrading of all
punishments’.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter3-footnote1" id=
"part3-chapter3-ref1a" name=
"part3-chapter3-ref1a">[1a]</a></small></sup> In the paradise of
the Kukis (India) the cut-throats who have in life killed the
largest number of aliens not only inherit the highest places, but
these adepts of the knife are supposed to be attended in their
celestial comings and goings by their victims as
slaves.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter3-footnote1" id=
"part3-chapter3-ref1b" name=
"part3-chapter3-ref1b">[1b]</a></small></sup> In his dealings with
the other members of his tribe, the savage observes a certain rude
code of morals, this code being usually, as in the case of the
civilised code, an inglorious mixture of equity and brutality,
superstition and sanity, honesty and hypocrisy. But the savage
recognises no moral obligations to any being outside of his tribe,
clan, or family. Anthropology teaches nothing more positively than
this. Consanguinity and self-interest are the only bases of savage
friendship. Outsiders are outlaws. They may be attacked, robbed,
deceived, murdered, eaten, or enslaved, with perfect propriety. It
was this general hostility of foreigners that Cain feared when he
was turned out from his countrymen after his crime upon Abel. He
knew that he was liable to be set upon by the first stranger that
came upon him. So the Lord is said to have set a mark upon him,
‘lest any finding him should kill him.’</p>
<p>‘There was no brotherhood recognised by our savage forefathers,’
says Sir Henry Maine, in speaking of the ancestors of the Aryan and
Semitic races, ‘except actual consanguinity regarded as a fact. If
a man was not of kin to another, there was nothing between them. He
was an enemy to be hated, slain, or despoiled as much as the wild
beasts upon which the tribe made war, as belonging, indeed, to the
craftiest and cruelest of wild animals. It would scarcely be too
strong to assert that the dogs which followed the camp had more in
common with it than the tribesmen of an alien and unrelated
tribe’.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter3-footnote2" id=
"part3-chapter3-ref2a" name=
"part3-chapter3-ref2a">[2a]</a></small></sup> Among some tribes of
savage men the ethical code is reversed in dealing with outsiders,
and enmity toward aliens is considered a duty.</p>
<p>This same senseless hostility toward every one from abroad, so
spitefully exhibited by primitive men, is also manifested by ants,
who immediately recognise and pounce upon an individual introduced
from a foreign colony, but welcome with every demonstration of joy,
even after a lapse of weeks or months, a returning member of their
own society. The same spirit of exclusiveness is found also in
elephants. If by accident an elephant becomes separated from his
herd, he becomes an outcast and a fugitive, never being permitted
in any circumstances to attach himself to another
herd.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter3-footnote3" id=

<p>That the savage should entertain feelings of friendship for
those belonging to the same social unit as himself is, considering
the circumstances in which it takes place, a perfectly natural
phenomenon. The members of his tribe are, to the savage, the beings
among whom he has come into existence, and in the midst of whom he
has grown up. He knows and understands them, and is known and
understood by them. They speak the same language as himself, and
cherish the same customs and traditions. They have the same sacred
trees, the same gods, the same experiences day after day, and the
same memories, as he himself. They are his associates in the chase,
his allies in war, and his comrades in sorrow and success. They are
the only beings into whose lives he has ever entered. They
constitute his world, and are to him the only real beings in the
universe.</p>
<p>The members of his tribe are, moreover, to the savage, for the
most part, his kinspeople. If they are not actually related to him
by blood, they are usually conceived by him to be so related. The
co-villagers of an Indian community call each other brothers. It is
a characteristic of all the Aryan and Semitic races when in the
tribal state to conceive that the tribes themselves, and all
subdivisions of them, are descended each from a single male
ancestor. The savage sees the living family of which he forms a
part descended from a single living man and his wife or wives. This
family group with which he is familiar and other similar groups
make up the tribe. And the process by which each family has been
brought about is in his mind identical with the process by which
the community as a whole has been formed.<sup><small><a href=
"#part3-chapter3-footnote2" id="part3-chapter3-ref2b" name=
"part3-chapter3-ref2b">[2b]</a></small></sup> It is a conception of
this kind, handed down as a tradition from ancient tribal times,
which causes the Jews even to-day to regard themselves as the
‘seed’ of that venerable sheik who, so many centuries ago, led them
as a band of nomads in their memorable migration westward from the
plains of Mesopotamia. It is not strange, therefore, considering
all of the circumstances in the midst of which the savage lives and
moves, that he should look upon his fellow-tribesmen as beings to
be distinguished by him from all other beings in the universe.</p>
<p>Nor is it strange, when we consider the mental sterility of the
savage, his lack of travel and imagination, the meagerness of his
experiences, and his utter ignorance of the world beyond the
community in which he lives, that he should look upon and treat all
outsiders as nobodies—as beings without any claims whatever upon
his humanity or mercy. The imagination is the picturing power of
the mind, the power by which beings are able to get out of
themselves and into the places of others, the power which enables
us to view the world comparatively—that is, from different points
of view. This power of mind, which imparts to the higher types of
intelligence their mobility and sympathy, is rudimentary in the
savage. This has been proved by Tylor in his study of the
comparative mythology of savages. It is this lack of imagination in
the savage, combined with his ignorance and his simplicity of life,
which gives to him his ferocity, and which renders him inaccessible
to those higher sentiments of justice and righteousness which
are—well, which are, at least, dreamed about and theorised about by
the more evolved savages of the ‘civilised world.’ The world, to
the simple mind of the savage, is, as it is to the mind of the
child, the world in which he lives and moves—the world which he
feels, hears, tastes, and sees. The horizon is the boundary of the
universe. Beings beyond his tribe are outside of the world. If they
exist at all, it is as a very different order of beings from him
and his people. They are not of kin to him, speak a strange tongue,
and have monstrous customs and superstitions. How could they be in
any way related to him? They are his enemies—vague villainous
apparitions who appear to him only in the horrible ordeals of
battle. His chief occupation is the waging of war against them, and
his keenest gratification is felt in laying them low. The accounts
of all travellers testify that the intertribal relations of savages
are, with few exceptions, those of chronic feud and hostility. The
irreconcilable antagonism between the savage and those around him
begets in the savage nature its dominating impulse—hate, hatred and
hostility toward other men, as well as toward all other beings. In
fact, the savage makes no moral distinction between man and the
other animals, but regards them all indiscriminately as his foes,
whom he must either use or remove from the face of the earth. The
savage hunts men about as he hunts other animals, and for a like
purpose. The Troglodytes hunted the Ethiopians in four-horse
chariots with as little compunction as Americans hunt antelopes
to-day.</p>

<h3 id="part3-chapter4">IV. The Ethics of the Ancient.</h3>
<p>But the doctrine that each petty tribe is the centre of the
world and the only real and important people in the universe, and
that all others are mere nobodies, is not peculiar to primitive
peoples. Ethnocentric ethics—the ethics of amity toward their own
tribe or state, their own clique or kind, and the ethics of enmity
toward outsiders—has been manifested to a greater or less extent by
the peoples of all times and of all degrees of enlightenment. Every
people that has ever existed has had its own particular point of
view, its own bias, its own knot-hole, large or small, through
which it has looked at life and the world. This is inevitable. It
arises as a necessary sequence out of the fact that all peoples
above savages are the descendants of savages, and as such have
inherited the limitations, mental and environmental, of those from
whom they have evolved.</p>
<p>Aliens had no legal rights in ancient times—none whatever.
International cooperation, such as exists among the political
societies of Europe and America to-day, was absolutely unknown.
International relations were everywhere those of hostility. States
and races looked upon each other as foes, as objects of plunder and
victimisation, not as friends.</p>
<p>Caesar says of the ancient Germans that depredations committed
beyond the boundaries of each state bore no infamy, and that
stealing from aliens was even encouraged as a means of teaching
their young men adroitness.</p>
<p>The ancient Jews are an excellent illustration of a narrow and
self-centred people. Notwithstanding their insignificance,
politically and intellectually, as compared with the Egyptians,
Greeks, and Persians, the Jews believed themselves to be the only
people of the first class inhabiting the earth. They conceived that
they had been selected as favourites by the gods themselves, and
that around their little district in half-arid Palestine revolved
the interests of the entire world. Their chief city was supposed to
be the sacred and central city of the world, and heaven itself only
a new and idealised edition of their metropolis. Every Jew was
bound to every other Jew by high-wrought ceremony and obligation.
But all non-Jews were ‘Gentiles,’ chaff-like ‘pagans,’ who
possessed no rights which a ‘child of Abraham’ was bound to
respect. Their tribal god is said to have been so indulgent toward
them as his ‘chosen people’ that he allowed them to exact usury
from foreigners, to sell them diseased meats, and to borrow jewels
from them and afterwards run away with them. He even permitted them
to make war upon weak peoples and dispossess them of their lands.
‘Whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them
will we possess’ (Judg. xi. 24).</p>
<p>The kings of the ancient Assyrians were so accustomed to
cruelties upon non-Assyrians, and were so proud of these cruelties,
that they recorded them in stone as a claim to immortality among
men. Assurbanipal, in speaking of the conquered, says: ‘I pulled
out their tongues and cut off their limbs, and caused them to be
eaten by dogs, bears, eagles, vultures, birds of heaven.’
Assur-natsir-pal, another wonderful fellow, boasts similarly: ‘I
flayed the nobles and covered the pyramid with their skins, and
their young men and maidens I burned as a holocaust.’ ‘Their
carcasses covered the valleys and the tops of the mountains,’ says
Tiglath-Pileser in his account of the slain Muskayans; and
Sennacherib informs us proudly that he drove his chariot over the
dead bodies of his victims until ‘its wheels were clogged with
flesh and blood.’ ‘Evidently’ remarks Spencer, in speaking of these
monstrous inscriptions, ‘the expectation was that men of
after-times would admire these merciless destructions; for we
cannot assume that these Assyrian kings intentionally made
themselves eternally infamous’.<sup><small><a href=
"#part3-chapter4-footnote1" id="part3-chapter4-ref1" name=
"part3-chapter4-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>To the ancient Greeks there were two classes of human beings in
the world: Greeks and ‘barbarians.’ The Greeks were the inhabitants
of Hellas, which was believed to be the central region of the
world, and the ‘barbarians’ were the godless denizens of the
less-favoured and less centrally located remainder of the earth.
The world was believed to be flat or shield-shaped, and in its
exact centre stood Mount Olympus in northern Thessaly. This
mountain, which is 9,700 feet high, was supposed to be the highest
elevation on the earth, and was the awful abode of the gods. The
Greeks called themselves Hellenes. According to their fabled
genealogy, they were the descendants of Hellen, son of Deucalion,
the Greek Noah. While they were often at war with each other, they
spoke a common language, and always regarded themselves as members
of a single family. All non-Greeks were ‘barbarians,’ including the
Romans, who were called ‘barbarians’ down to the time of Augustus.
While the Greeks themselves traced their ancestry back to the
bright blood of the gods, the ‘barbarians’ were generally supposed
to have originated from stones and trees. The ‘barbarians’ were
looked upon and treated by the Greeks everywhere as a different
order of beings from themselves. Those taken by them in war were
regularly reduced to slavery. The slave population created in this
way was increased by the slave traffic carried on with the East
until the slave population of Greece was several times as great as
the free population. The whole Hellenic world, in fact, even in the
days of its greatest magnificence, was one vast pen of slaves.
Almost every freeman of Attica was a slave-owner. Out of a
population of about five hundred thousand, four hundred thousand
were slaves. It was considered a real hardship by the Greeks to be
compelled to get along with less than a half-dozen slaves. In
Corinth and Aegina there were ten slaves to one freeman. In Sparta
the slaves were the vanquished Helots, the original inhabitants of
the Peloponnesus, whom the Spartans had conquered and reduced to
chains in early times. Their lot was particularly horrible. They
were the property of the state, and were distributed to the Spartan
lords by lot. ‘They practically had no rights which their masters
felt bound to respect. If one of their number displayed unusual
powers of either body or mind, he was secretly assassinated, as it
was deemed unsafe to allow such qualities to be fostered in the
servile class. It is affirmed [by Thucydides] that, when the Helots
grew too numerous for the supposed safety of the state, their
numbers were thinned by deliberate massacre of the surplus
population’.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter4-footnote2" id=
"part3-chapter4-ref2" name=
"part3-chapter4-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup> The conception of human
slavery entertained by the common mass of Greeks may be inferred
from the fact that philosophers like Aristotle taught that ‘slaves
were simply domestic animals possessed of intelligence.’ It is this
fact, this utter lack of justice and humanity manifested by the
Greeks in their treatment of non-Hellenic mankind, which gives to
Greek ‘civilisation’ its seamy side. Greek society has been
appropriately likened to a pyramid, its apex gleaming with light
and splendour, while its base was sunk in darkness.</p>
<p>Non-Romans were called ‘barbarians’ also by the Romans, and were
considered by the Romans to be an entirely different order of
beings from themselves. Any splinter of a Roman was, according to
the Romans, superior to the most illustrious ‘barbarian.’ Men were
not treated nor estimated according to their intrinsic qualities,
but wholly as to whether they were or were not ‘Roman citizens.’ To
be a ‘Roman citizen’ was to be entitled to everything; to be a
‘barbarian’ was not to be entitled to anything necessarily, except
to serve in some way the all-glorious Romans. The elaborate legal
and ethical codes formulated by these masters of the Mediterranean
were reserved religiously for themselves. The business of the
‘barbarians’ was to furnish fields for pillage and conquest, to
impart magnitude to triumphal pageants, to act as slaves, and to
die by ignominiously butchering each other for the amusement of
their bloodthirsty masters. ‘Barbarian’ lands were looked upon
simply as game-preserves where ambitious captains from the Tiber
went to refresh their reputations by hunting and victimising the
inhabitants. The history of Rome is the history of infamy on a
colossal, almost world-wide, scale. There has never been displayed
by any people pretending to be civilised such shameless savagery as
that displayed by the Romans in their gladiatorial arenas, where
men (generally the captives of war) were ‘butchered to make a Roman
holiday.’ These tragedies, in their magnitude and atrocity, seem
almost frightful when we read of them on the pages of history. They
were generally celebrated by victorious captains and emperors at
the close of some unusual outrage against the ‘barbarians,’ or upon
the departure of Roman legions for the field of activity. The
celebrations sometimes lasted weeks, or even months. The Emperor
Trajan celebrated his victories over the Dacians with shows that
lasted more than a hundred days. During this horrible festival ten
thousand men fought upon the arena, and more than ten thousand wild
animals were slain. The gladiators in these ancient combats fought
in chariots, on horseback, on foot—in all the ways in which
soldiers fought in actual battle. They fought with swords, lances,
daggers, tridents, and every other manner of weapon. Some had nets
and lassoes with which they entangled their adversaries, and then
slew them. The life of a wounded gladiator was in the hands of the
spectators, who showed their clemency or their lack of it by
turning their thumbs respectively down or up. The thirst of the
populace for blood was sometimes such that the dying were aroused
and forced on to the fight by burning with a hot iron. The dead
bodies were dragged from the arena with hooks, like the carcasses
of animals, and the pools of blood soaked up with dry
sand.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter4-footnote3" id=
"part3-chapter4-ref3a" name=
"part3-chapter4-ref3a">[3a]</a></small></sup> There was an
occasional Roman, like Seneca, sane enough to realise the real
character of these performances, and brave enough to denounce them
as crimes. But by the great mass of all classes of Romans, even by
those who pretended to think, they were regarded with perfect moral
indifference. The excuse offered by Pliny was generally concurred
in by his countrymen, that these bloody shows were necessary for
the cultivation of manliness and for keeping awake the strenuous
and red-handed instincts in the young.</p>
<p>Scarce less revolting than the gladiatorial arena, in its
violation of every principle of humanity, was the institution of
human slavery. During the later republic and the earlier empire,
one-half the population of the Roman state was slaves. The slave
population was recruited chiefly, as in Greece, by war and by
slave-hunting. Slave-traders and slave-markets flourished both in
the capital itself and in all the great ports visited by Roman
ships. Some of the outlying provinces of Asia and Africa were
almost depopulated by the slave-hunters. Greek slaves were the
highest-priced, because the most intelligent. Among the wealthy,
who, like the illiterate rich of every age, dawdled their time in
ostentation, there were slaves for each different function in the
household. There were the <em>cubicularii</em>, who acted as
housemaids; the <em>triclinarii</em>, who waited at table; the
<em>culinarii</em>, who acted as kitchen drudges; and the
<em>balnearii</em>, who looked after the baths. Then there were
<em>tonsores</em> or barbers; <em>criniflores</em>, or
hair-crimpers; <em>calceatores</em>, who took care of the feet; and
<em>lectores</em>, whose business it was to read aloud to their
masters at meals, in the bath, or in bed. The <em>ostiarius</em>,
who was sometimes chained in the vestibule like a dog, was the
porter; the <em>invitator</em> summoned the guests; and the
<em>servus ab hospitiis</em> looked after their lodgment. There was
the slave called the <em>sandalio</em>, whose sole duty was to care
for his master’s sandals; and another, called the
<em>nomenclator</em>, whose exclusive business it was to accompany
his master when he went upon the street, and give him the names of
such persons as he ought to recognise. The common punishment for a
refractory slave was beating. If the runaway were caught, as he
could hardly fail to be, since there were extremely heavy penalties
for harbouring or assisting him, he was either branded or had an
iron collar like a dog’s welded around his neck, or his legs were
fettered, or, in exaggerated or repeated cases of offence, he was
at once turned into the arena or otherwise put to death. If he
attempted to take personal vengeance upon his master for any wrong
whatsoever, his whole family shared his fate, and the regular form
of capital punishment for a slave was crucifixion under the most
ignominious and agonising circumstances.<sup><small><a href=
"#part3-chapter4-footnote4" id="part3-chapter4-ref4" name=
"part3-chapter4-ref4">[4]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>‘In many cases, as a measure of precaution, the slaves were
forced to work in chains and to sleep in subterranean prisons. The
feeling entertained toward this unfortunate class in the later
republican period is illustrated by Varro’s classification of
slaves as “vocal agricultural implements,” and by Cato the Elder’s
recommendation that old and worn-out slaves be sold, as a matter of
economy. Sick and hopelessly infirm slaves were taken to an island
in the Tiber, and there left to die of starvation and
exposure’.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter4-footnote3" id=
"part3-chapter4-ref3b" name=
"part3-chapter4-ref3b">[3b]</a></small></sup> Slaves were
practically without any rights whatever to the world in which they
lived. A Roman could take the life of his Gallic slave with as
complete impunity as an American can slay his bovine servant
to-day. Romans, in short, looked upon and treated non-Romans about
as human beings to-day look upon and treat non-humans—<em>as mere
prey</em>.</p>

<h3 id="part3-chapter5">V. Modern Ethics.</h3>
<p>But the peoples of the ancient world are not the only human
beings who have suffered from the psychological bequests of
savages. Modern states and peoples, notwithstanding their far-flung
professions of righteousness, manifest, though in a somewhat
weakened form, the same ethnic prejudices and the same senseless
antipathies as those displayed by the ancients. Remnants of the
primitive tribal morality are found in the moral habits and
conceptions of every people, however emancipated they may imagine
themselves to be. Many a person who would not think of swindling
one of his neighbours will not hesitate to swindle a foreigner,
especially if the foreigner happens to be of a nationality much
removed in language, colour, manners, or interests from his own.
Morality is genetic. It is not a consistent something—something
reasoned out and framed according to the facts. It has grown up. It
is essentially tribal—whether it is confined to a family, as is
done by some, to a corporation or trade, to a nation, to an
artificial fraternity, or to a species. We are, in fact, all of us,
even the broadest and most illuminated, simply savages more or less
leafed out. We all suffer, as men have always suffered, from the
over-vividness of the presentative powers of the mind (sensation
and perception) compared with the representative powers (memory and
imagination). We all exaggerate out of their proper perspective in
the phenomena of a universe the things that are around us and about
us—the events we witness or take part in, the things that are ours,
and the affairs of the street, city, state, neighbourhood, world,
and time, in which we live. Every human being (the sage less than
the savage, but the sage to some extent) is inclined to lump
together as foreign to him, and as more or less useless and shadowy
in themselves, the things, beings, and events that are distant, and
to consider them, of less reality than those with which he is
directly concerned, and of which his knowledge is immediate.
<em>The evolution of consciousness in its social and ethical
aspects consists in the evolution of the ability to make real and
vivid the phenomena that are more and more</em> <em>distant in both
space and time</em>.</p>
<p>The Chinese call their country ‘the flower of the middle,’ and
believe it to be the central and choicest portion of the earth’s
surface. All those beyond the bounds of ‘The Heavenly Flower
Kingdom’ are, by those on the inside, venomously lumped together as
‘foreign devils.’ The people of Spain look upon themselves in much
the same way as the Chinese look upon themselves, although they are
in reality the most belated of all peoples to-day pretending to be
civilised. There are a few travelled and educated Spaniards who
realise the pitiful place held by their country in the family of
reputable states. ‘But the great mass of the people are not only
perfectly satisfied with their condition, but consider themselves
the most fortunate of all God’s creatures. They never go outside of
their country and never read a foreign newspaper or book. Like the
Chinese, they consider other nations barbarians, and point to
Madrid as the centre of civilisation.’ The French, down to the
nineteenth century, confiscated the property of all aliens who died
within the realm; and the savage practice of punishing one alien
for the crimes of another alien was sanctioned by the laws of
England down to the middle of the fourteenth century. It has been
only a day in the history of the world since Caucasians hunted
their dusky brothers in Africa like ‘wild animals,’ and sold and
loaned and lashed them as we do horses to-day. Men now living can
remember when it made no difference how exalted in character men
might be: if a certain pigment of their bodies was dark, they were
‘niggers.’ They had no ‘souls’ as pale men had, and no more chance
of paradise than cattle. At the beginning of the nineteenth
century, incredible as it may seem, every country of Europe and
America held slaves, and was engaged in the soulless avocation of
man-hunting in Africa. Tens of thousands of Africa’s children were
annually seized by prowling pirate bands and exported to distant
lands to wear their lives out in disgrace and drudgery. It was not
until the latter part of the nineteenth century that civilised
nations, following the initiative of England, finally abolished
human slavery, the United States and Brazil being the last to act.
The Christian sneers at all who do not bow down to his deities and
worship according to his ritual, as ‘heathens’ or ‘freethinkers,’
and to the Moslem all who are not followers of ‘the True Prophet’
are ‘infidel dogs.’ The history of these two religions is a
chronicle of almost unparalleled crimes upon disbelievers.</p>
<p>But it is not necessary to go to Arabia or Cathay, nor even
necessary to read history, in order to find examples of bigotry and
provincialism. It is only necessary to open our eyes. Americans are
not a peculiar people—unless it be in the unbridled character of
their conceit. All the barbarism is not behind us nor around us.
History looks dark and discouraging to us, as we turn its terrible
pages, but we would see something just as discouraging if we would
look into a mirror. The old savage spirit still circulates in our
veins. The ‘foreigner’ is not an enemy, but he is still an
individual whose chief significance is in his ‘fleece.’ If the
‘foreigner’ did not ease our economic theories by benevolently
‘paying the tax,’ it would be hard to tell what would become of
him. Those who suffer from a different government, speak a
different language, or laud other gods are regarded by us as
distinctly inferior to ourselves. Millions of dollars are annually
squandered by self-righteous societies in sending missionaries to
the other side of the planet to peoples who need evangels of mercy
and humanity far less than we do ourselves. In these times of
ecclesiastical enterprise, however, missionaries are being
superseded, as agents of evangelisation, by the more effective
inventions of Messrs. Maxim and Krupp. ‘American’ is regarded by us
as the synonym of perfection, and to be ‘patriotic’ is to give
unthinking enthusiasm to every scheme incubated by wolfish
spoilsmen. Crimes of conquest carried on by others become, when
undertaken by us, shining masterpieces of ‘benevolent
assimilation.’ We are not so far from the naked and unkempt
contemporaries of the cave-bear and sabre-toothed lion as we
imagine we are. To carry a bayonet, and especially to redden it
with an alien’s blood, is here in this degenerate land of
Jefferson, more glorious than to create a book. Captains
particularly competent as butchers, though their characters be as
coarse as a savage chief’s, are hailed as heroes by thousands
besides silly women, and held up, like the cutthroats of the Kukis,
as the highest exemplars of right-doing. Old Rameses, holding by
their hair a half-dozen dwarfs, and ostentatiously cutting off
their heads with a single sweep of his sword, finds his modern
counterpart in miserable Americans pompously gloating over the
offhand slaughter of the children of distant archipelagoes.</p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter6">VI. The Ethics of Human Beings Toward
Non-human Beings.</h3>
<p>But the most mournful instance of provincial ethics afforded by
the inhabitants of the earth is not that furnished by the varieties
of the human species in their conduct toward each other, but that
afforded by the human race as a whole in its treatment of the
non-human races. Human nature is nowhere so hideous, and human
conscience is nowhere so profoundly inoperative, as in their
disregard for the life and happiness of the non-human animal world.
With the development of the representative powers of the mind, the
widening and mutualising of human activities, and the consequent
enlargement of the human horizon, the feeling of amity has spread
and intensified, until to-day, notwithstanding all that is true of
human sectionalism, the ethical systems of civilised peoples
include, theoretically at least, and more or less seriously, all
human beings whatsoever. Ethical consciousness has extended from
individual to family, from family to clan, from clan to tribe, from
tribe to confederacy, from confederacy to kingdom, from kingdom to
race, from race to species, until, in the case of many millions of
men, ethical feeling has reached, with greater or less vividness
and consistency, the anthropocentric stage of evolution. The fact
that an individual is a <em>man</em>—that is, that he belongs to
the human species of animals—entitles him in all civilised lands to
the fundamental rights and privileges of existence. The rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are believed to-day, by
all exalted minds, to be the inalienable properties of every
<em>human</em> being who comes into the world.</p>
<p>But, except by occasional individuals here and there whose
emotions are more civilised than the rest, or whose conceptions are
more ample and clear, ethical relations are not extended by human
beings beyond the bounds of their own species. Non-human millions
are <em>outsiders</em>. They are looked upon and treated by human
beings as if they were an entirely different order of existences,
with entirely different purposes and susceptibilities, from human
beings. They are not considered to be living beings at all, as
human beings are, who are here in the world to enjoy life and all
that life holds that is dear to a living being. They belong to the
same class of existences as the waves of the sea and the weeds of
the field. They are looked upon as mere <em>things</em>—mere
moving, multiplying objects, without the slightest equity in the
world in which they find themselves. They may be set upon, beaten,
maimed, starved, assassinated, eaten, insulted, deceived,
imprisoned, robbed, tormented, skinned alive, shot down for
pastime, cut to pieces out of curiosity, or compelled to undergo
any other enormity or victimisation anybody can think of or is
disposed to visit upon them. It is enough almost to make knaves
shudder, the cold-blooded and business-like manner in which we cut
their throats, dash out their brains, and discuss their flavour at
our cannibalistic feasts. As Plutarch says, ‘Lions, tigers, and
serpents we call savage and ferocious, yet we ourselves come behind
them in no species of barbarity.’ Accustomed from our cradle up to
look upon violence and assassination, we have become so habituated
and hardened to these things that we perpetrate them and see them
perpetrated with the same indifference as that with which we watch
waves die on the beach. Human beings are, in fact (‘paragons’
though they pretend to be), the most predatory and brutal of all
animals—the great bone-breakers and bone-pickers of the planet.</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible, astounding as it is, to commit crimes
upon any beings in this world, except men. There are no beings in
the universe, according to human beings, except themselves. All
others are commodities. They are of consequence only because they
have thighs and can fill up the unoccupied places of the human
alimentary. Human beings are ‘persons,’ and have souls and gods and
places to go to when they die. But the hundreds of thousands of
other races of terrestrial inhabitants are mere ‘animals,’ mere
‘brutes,’ and ‘beasts of the field,’ ‘livestock’ and ‘vermin.’
Every crime capable of being perpetrated by one being upon another
is day after day rained upon them, and with an equanimity that
would do honour to the managers of an inferno. Human beings preach
as the cardinal rule of morality—and they seem never to tire of its
reiteration—that they should do unto others as they would that
others would do unto them; but they hypocritically confine its
application to the members of their own crowd, notwithstanding
there are the same reasons identically for extending it to all
creatures. The happiness of the human species is assumed to be so
much more precious than that of others that the most sacred
interests of others are unhesitatingly sacrificed in order that
human desires may all be fastidiously catered to. Even for a tooth
or a feather or a piece of skin to wear on human vanity, forests
are depopulated and the land filled with the dead and dying.
Assassination is the commonest and most fashionable of human
pastimes. Jaded systems are regularly recuperated by massacre. Men
arm themselves—men who roar about ‘rights,’ and even ministers of
mercy—and go out on killing expeditions with as little compunction
as savages put on war-paint. They come back from their campaigns of
crime like the cut-throats of old Rome, trailing their victims as
trophies, and expecting to be hailed as heroes for the hells they
have established. Barbarians preponderate, and morality is turned
inside out. Cruelty is lionised, and broad-mindedness is rewarded
with a sneer. Compassion is a disease, and to be fashionable is to
be a fiend. If non-human peoples had no nerves and no choice of
emotions, and were utterly indifferent to life, they could scarcely
be treated more completely as personal nonentities.</p>
<p>The denial by human animals of ethical relations to the rest of
the animal world is a phenomenon not differing either in character
or cause from the denial of ethical relations by a tribe, people,
or race of human beings to the rest of the human world. The
provincialism of Jews toward non-Jews, of Greeks toward non-Greeks,
of Romans toward non-Romans, of Moslems toward non-Moslems, and of
Caucasians toward non-Caucasians, is not one thing and the
provincialism of human beings toward non-human beings another. They
are all manifestations of the same thing. The fact that these
various acts are performed by different individuals and
<em>upon</em> different individuals, and are performed at different
times and places, does not invalidate the essential sameness of
their natures. Crimes are not classified (except by savages or
their immediate derivatives) according to the similarity of those
who do them or those who suffer from them, but by grouping them
according to the similarity of their intrinsic qualities. All acts
of provincialism consist essentially in the disinclination or
inability to be universal, and they belong in reality, all of them,
to the same species of conduct. There is, in fact, but one great
crime in the universe, and most of the instances of terrestrial
wrong-doing are instances of this crime. It is the crime of
<em>exploitation</em>—the considering by some beings of themselves
as <em>ends</em> and of others as their <em>means</em>—the refusal
to recognise the equal, or the approximately equal, rights of all
to life and its legitimate rewards—the crime of acting toward
others as one would that others would <em>not</em> act toward him.
For millions of years, almost ever since life began, this crime has
been committed, in every nook and quarter of the inhabited
globe.</p>
<p><em>Every being</em> is an <em>end</em>. In other words, every
being is to be taken into account in determining the ends of
conduct. This is the only consistent outcome of the ethical process
which is in course of evolution on the earth. This world was not
made and presented to any particular clique for its exclusive use
or enjoyment. The earth belongs, if it belongs to anybody, to the
beings who inhabit it—to <em>all</em> of them. And when one being
or set of beings sets itself up as the sole end for which the
universe exists, and looks upon and acts toward others as mere
means to this end, it is usurpation, nothing else and never can be
anything else, it matters not by whom or upon whom the usurpation
is practised. A tyrant who puts his own welfare and aggrandisement
in the place of the welfare of a people, and compels the whole
people to act as a means to his own personal ends, is not more
certainly a usurper than is a species or variety which puts its
welfare in the place of the welfare of all the inhabitants of a
world. The refusal to put one’s self in the place of others and to
act toward them as one would that they would act toward him does
not depend for its wrongfulness upon who makes the refusal or upon
whether the refusal falls upon this or that individual or set.
Deeds are right and wrong in themselves; and whether they are right
or wrong, good or evil, proper or improper, whether they should be
done or should not be done, <em>depends upon their effects upon the
welfare of the inhabitants of the universe</em>. The basic mistake
that has ever been made in this egoistic world in the judging and
classifying of acts has been the mistake of judging and classifying
them with reference to their effects upon some particular fraction
of the inhabitants of the universe. In pure egoism conduct is
judged as good or bad solely with reference to the results,
immediate or remote, which that conduct produces, or is calculated
to produce, on the <em>self</em>. To the savage, that is right or
wrong which affects favourably or unfavourably <em>himself</em> or
his <em>tribe</em>. And this sectional spirit of the savage has, as
has been shown, characterised the moral conceptions of the peoples
of all times. The practice human beings have to-day—the practice of
those (relatively) broad and emancipated minds who are large enough
to rise above the petty prejudices and ‘patriotisms’ of the races
and corporations of men, and are able to view ‘the world as their
country’ (the world of <em>human</em> beings, of course)—the
practice such minds have of estimating conduct solely with
reference to its effects upon the human species of animals is a
practice which, while infinitely broader and more nearly ultimate
than that of the savage, belongs logically in the same category
with it. The partially emancipated human being who extends his
moral sentiments to all the members of his own species, but denies
to all other species the justice and humanity he accords to his
own, is making on a larger scale the same ethical mess of it as the
savage. The only consistent attitude, since Darwin established the
unity of life (and the attitude we shall assume, if we ever become
really civilised), is the attitude of <em>universal gentleness and
humanity</em>.</p>
<p>‘The world is my country,’ said Thomas Paine, and every man,
woman, and child capable of appreciating the exalted sentiment
applauded. But ‘the world’ of the great freethinker was inhabited
by <em>men only</em>.</p>
<p>The following lines were written by Robert Whitaker, and first
printed in a San Francisco newspaper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘My Country is the world! I count<br />
No son of man my foe,<br />
Whether the warm life currents mount<br />
And mantle brows like snow,<br />
Or whether yellow, brown, or black,<br />
The face that into mine looks back.<br />
<br />
‘My Native Land is Mother Earth,<br />
And all men are my kin,<br />
Whether of rude or gentle birth,<br />
However steeped in sin;<br />
Or rich or poor, or great or small,<br />
I count them brothers one and all.<br />
<br />
‘My Flag is the star-spangled sky,<br />
Woven without a seam,<br />
Where dawn and sunset colours lie,<br />
Fair as an angel’s dream,<br />
The Flag that still unstained, untorn,<br />
Floats over all of mortal born<br />
<br />
‘My Party is all humankind,<br />
My Platform, brotherhood;<br />
I count all men of honest mind<br />
Who work for human good,<br />
And for the hope that gleams afar.<br />
My comrades in the holy war.<br />
<br />
‘My Country is the world! I scorn<br />
No lesser love than mine,<br />
But calmly wait that happy morn<br />
When all shall own this sign,<br />
And love of country, as of clan,<br />
Shall yield to love of Man.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert Whitaker, you are a grand improvement on the ‘jingo.’ But
you are still too small. There are conceptions as much more
prophetic and exalted than yours as your conception is superior to
that of the Figian.</p>
<p>Broad as he is who can look upon all men as his brethren and
countrymen—broad as he is compared with those groundlings called
‘patriots,’ who can see nothing clearly beyond the bounds of the
political unit to which they belong—he is not broad enough. He is
still a <em>sectionalist</em>, a <em>partialist</em>. He represents
but a <em>stage</em> in the process of ethical expansion. He is, in
fact, small compared with the <em>universalist</em>, just as the
savage is small compared with the philanthropist. ‘Mankind,’
‘humanity,’ ‘all men,’ ‘the whole human family’—these are big
conceptions, too big for the poor little nubbins of brains with
which most millions make the effort to think. But they are
pitifully small compared with that grand conception of kinship
which takes in all the races that live and move upon the earth.
Smaller yet are these conceptions compared with that sublime and
supreme synthesis which embraces not only the present generation of
terrestrial inhabitants, but which extends longitudinally as well
as laterally, extends in time as well as in space, and embraces the
generations which shall grow out of the existing generation and
which are yet unborn—<em>that conception which recognises
earth-life as a single process, world-wide and immortal, every part
related and akin to every other party and each generation linked to
an unending posterity</em>.</p>
<p>Every individual, therefore, emancipated enough to judge of acts
of conduct according to their intrinsic natures and consequences
rather than according to some local or traditional bias, cannot
help knowing that the exploitation of birds and quadrupeds for
human whim or convenience is an offence against the laws of
morality, not different in kind from the offences denounced in
human laws as robbery and murder. The creophagist and the hunter
exemplify the same somnambulism, are the authors of the same kind
of conduct, and belong literally in the same category of offenders,
as the cannibal and the slave-driver. To take the life of an ox for
his muscles, or to kill a sheep for his skin is <em>murder</em>,
and those who do these things or cause them to be done are
<em>murderers</em> just as actually as highwaymen are who blow off
the heads of hapless wayfarers for their guineas. If these things
<em>seem untrue</em> it is not because they <em>are</em> untrue,
but because those to whom they seem so <em>are unable to judge
conduct from the quadrupedal point of view</em>. If there were in
this world beings as much more clever than Caucasians as Caucasians
are more clever than cows and sheep, and these beings should regard
themselves as the darlings of the gods and should attach a
fictitious dignity and importance to their own lives, but should
look upon Caucasians as simply so much ‘beef’ and ‘mutton,’ these
bleached terrorists of the world would in the course of a few
generations of experience probably become sufficiently illumined to
realise that current human conceptions of cows and sheep are not
only preposterous, but fiendish.</p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter7">VII. The Origin of Provincialism.</h3>
<p>Human provincialism, all of it, is the consequence of a common
cause—<em>the provincialism of the savage</em>. Back of the
provincialism of the savage is, of course, the antecedent fact of
primordial egoism. The savage is the common ancestor of all men,
and as such has imparted to all men their general characters of
mind and heart. Everything that grows, whether it be a tree, a
human being, a grass blade, or a race, grows from something. This
something, this germ or embryo from which each thing springs,
imparts to the thing its fundamental characters. However far
anything may evolve, and however much it may come to differ
superficially from its original, it will always remain at heart
more or less faithful to the facts of its genesis. This hereditary
tendency of everything, this tendency toward invariability, is the
conservative, or inertial tendency of the universe. All races,
colours, and conditions of men—civilised, slightly civilised, and
barbarous—extend back to, and take root in, savages, just as all
savages have probably sprung in some still more remote period of
the past from a single stirp of anthropoids. The savage is,
therefore, the author of human nature and philosophy. Just as the
fish, which is the common ancestor of all amphibians, reptiles,
birds, and mammals, has predetermined the general structural style
of all subsequently evolved vertebrates, so the savage, as the
original ancestor of mankind, has predetermined the general mental
and dispositional make-up of all higher men. That civilised and
semi-civilised men are naturally narrow and revengeful, selfish and
superstitious, and find it next to impossible to feel and act
toward others as they would like to have others feel and act toward
them, is, therefore, not more mysterious than that vertebrates have
red blood, two eyes, two pairs of limbs, and a backbone with a
bulging brain-box at the hither end of it. Just as the habits,
beliefs, and conceptions of the child persist, often but slightly
modified, in the full-grown man or woman, so the habits, beliefs,
and conceptions, formed by the race in its childhood, continue,
under the influence of the same laws of inertia, on into the more
mature stages of racial development. Human nature changes with
great reluctance, and only in its superficial aspects at that.
There are cave-men, men with the primitive ideas and practices of
the Stone Age, and men in the pastoral and hunting stages of
mankind, in all the highest societies of men. There is scarcely a
habit, vice, occupation, amusement, crime, or trait of character,
found among men of the past but may be seen still among our
contemporaries.</p>
<p>Altruism (other-love) is just as natural as egoism (self-love)
is. There is not so much of it in the world as there is of egoism.
But that is simply the misfortune of our place of existence. There
is no reason why there might not have been as much, or even more,
under different conditions. With the same antecedents, nothing can,
of course, happen differently from what does happen. But with
different antecedents, different causes, the results are bound to
be different. Civilised men are not beings of altruism, because
they are not the <em>effects</em> of that kind of <em>causes</em>.
But there is no reason why there might not be a world—several of
them, in fact, or even a universeful—where the inhabitants have
never known or heard of such an indelicate thing as of beings
preferring themselves to others—where it is as natural for them to
act toward each other according to what we call the Golden Rule as
it is for us terrestrial heathens to violate it. It is possible to
conceive of beings with even too much altruism. The ideal condition
is one of balanced egoism and altruism—one in which each thinks as
much of others as he does of himself, no more and no less. And if
beings were endowed with natures rendering them not only willing
but <em>determined</em> to act primarily in the interests of
others, and this condition of things were universal, there would be
about as much discord and strife as if everyone acted in the
interest of himself. The Golden Rule among a lot of hypothetical
otherists like this would be the opposite of ours, for, instead of
emphasising the importance of others as we do, they would need to
encourage regard for self. Wouldn’t it seem original to live in a
world where men were sent to gaol for over-benevolence, and where
sermons had to be preached on such texts as, ‘Love thyself as thy
neighbour’; ‘It is more blessed to receive than to give’; ‘Avoid
doing to yourself that which you do not like when done to others’;
‘The Lord loves a cheerful taker’; and the like?</p>
<p>The persistence with which savage ideas and instincts continue
to influence men long after those ideas and instincts have really
become anachronistic and vestigial is well illustrated by civilised
men and women everywhere. The sun continues to ‘rise’ and ‘set’ in
all civilised lands just as it used to do to the savage, although
men have long since learned that it does not do either. Hell, as
originally conceived, was an actual subterranean region, and heaven
was an abode located a few hours’ journey above the supposedly flat
earth. To-day we continue to say ‘<em>up</em> to heaven,’ and
‘<em>down</em> to hell’ (never ‘down to heaven’ and ‘up to hell’),
and always think of these places as being thus relatively located,
although it is extremely doubtful whether any really sane mind
continues to believe that hell is on the inside of the earth (or
any place else, for that matter), and although <em>up</em> means
simply away from the centre of the earth, and away from the centre
of a ball means literally every possible direction. The theological
theories of the origin, nature, and destiny of man and of the
universe in general, all of which originated in savage or
semi-savage minds, and all of which bear the unmistakable traces of
their origin, continue to cling to the minds of the masses of
civilised men, notwithstanding the inherent absurdity of these
theories, and notwithstanding the fact that their unsoundness is
vouched for by the most positive and unanimous assurances from the
scientific world. Why should civilised men and women, any of them,
be indifferent to the sufferings of others, or find delight in such
loathsome avocations as the fishing and hunting of their
fellow-creatures? Because their ancestors were savages, and they
are not yet sufficiently evolved to be independent of the instincts
of their savage sires. There is no other explanation. No human
being could enjoy seeing a pack of hounds hunt down and rend to
pieces a poor harmless hare—unless he were a savage. No human being
could go out to the abodes of the squirrel and quail, and shoot
murderous balls into their beautiful bodies for food or fun—unless
he were a savage. No human being would lounge all day about the
margins of a brook, blind to the beauties of the stream and the
glories of forest and sky, in order to thrust brutal hooks into the
lips of those whom he deceives, and drag them from their waters to
suffocate in the sun—unless he were a savage. No human being would
have palaces and parks and yachts and equipages, townships of
lands, packs of hounds, and studs of horses, troops of lackeys and
nothing to do, when all around him are the men and women who made
this wealth, half clad and half starved, suffocating in shanties
and working like wretches from morning till night—unless he were a
savage. All of these deeds are savage deeds, deeds of exceeding
thoughtlessness and brutality, and, instead of being enjoyable, are
to every emancipated mind positively painful.</p>
<p>Hunting, fishing, and fighting are the chief occupations of
savage life. Back of the activities displayed in these occupations
are powerful instincts prompting and sustaining them. Civilised
peoples are devoted primarily to the arts of industry and peace.
But there are enough savages in every civilised society, and enough
of the savage spirit in those who pretend to approximate the
civilised state, to give to civilised life a decidedly barbaric
aspect. War is a more or less regular exercise, and killing and
competing and torturing enter largely into the pastimes of all
peoples. Next to eating, fighting, in one form or another, is the
favourite pursuit of men nearly everywhere on holy days and days of
leisure. Whenever human beings have any energy or time left over
from what they are required to spend in maintaining their
existence, they use it in fighting somebody or in watching somebody
else fight. And generally the more brutal and sanguinary the
conflict, the more popular and satisfying it is. Witness the
bull-fights and cock-fights of Spain and Mexico, the fisticuffs of
Anglo-Saxons, and the baseball and slugball battles of the
Americans, where eager thousands gather and roar for hours like
hysterical idiots simply to see one animal or set of animals punish
or discredit another. If there are no pigeons to shoot, or if the
community is ruled by men and women who are too emancipated to
allow such things, we make glass birds and heroically bang away at
them, supplying by our imaginations the blood and agony of real
carnage. And if we can’t do anything else, we take some poor pig,
that never did anyone any harm in the world, and grease it and turn
it loose, and then take after it with knives, as Chicago butchers
do on vacation days, and see who can cut its throat the quickest.
This amusement, in pure barbarity, certainly stands pretty near the
top in the list of human pastimes so far invented. Maybe it is
outclassed by that other contest sometimes advertised as a feature
of butchers’ barbecues, in which a band of professional cutthroats
compete to see who can kill, skin, and eviscerate the largest
number of their fellow-beings in a given time.</p>
<p>Games and other performances in which interest is aroused by
contending or killing are all of them entertainments gotten up
primarily for the amusement of the under-exercised savage within
us. The bloody carnivals of the ancient Romans, which seem so
incomprehensible to the people of to-day, find their diabolical
parallels right here in our high-sniffing civilisation. The
bull-pen, where poor quadrupeds are baited by gorgeous assassins
for the amusement of Castilian communities, and the cockpit and the
prize-ring, where irate fowls and naked thugs peck and pound each
other to insensibility for the entertainment of blood-loving mobs,
are the legitimate successors of the gladiatorial arena of the
Romans. The gladiatorial horror is not changed, either in its
nature or functions, by changing the combatants to cocks and bulls.
The ringside roars that rise to-day beside the Tagus and the Hudson
over the fatal thrust of the matador or the knockout lunge of the
pugilist are howls of barbaric elation arising from the
satisfaction of the same instincts as those which seventeen
centuries ago made amphitheatres thunder at the spectacle of gutted
Gauls. The ability to enjoy strife and suffering in one form is not
different in kind from the ability to be entertained by strife and
suffering in any other form. Beings who can follow in riotous glee
the terrified form of a fleeing stag, or shout ecstatically at
sight of the death-stagger of a mangled ox, are psychologically
equipped to go into raptures over the blood-curdling combustions of
a literal hell.</p>
<p>Few pastimes indulged in by civilised peoples are more horrible
to an emancipated mind than that of bull-fighting. It is the
national amusement of Spain, and is carried on among all peoples
who have acquired their natures and institutions from the Spanish.
‘Every Sunday afternoon, whenever the weather permits, 14,000 or
15,000 men and women, representing every class of society, mothers
and grandmothers, priests and monks, assemble at the Plaza de Toros
in Madrid to witness the most brutal spectacle the human taste
approves. Six bulls are tortured and worried until they are
exhausted. Then they are killed by the thrusts of the sword of a
matador, who is the most popular person in the community and makes
more money than any other man. Often as many as twelve horses are
ripped open by the horns of the infuriated bulls, and are allowed
to die in the presence of the audience, with blood gushing from
their wounds and their entrails dragging upon the ground. This sort
of thing is carried on not only in Madrid, but is a regular weekly
festival in all the cities of Spain. The horses are blindfolded, so
they cannot even see what attacks them. The men who torture the
bulls have wooden screens behind which they can dodge when pursued,
and if one of the baited creatures crowds too closely upon any of
its tormentors, the other matadors throw a blanket over its head.
It is not sport, for the poor bulls have no chance whatever to
escape or to fight back. It is simply slow butchery, an exhibition
of unmitigated cowardice and cruelty. And yet, although the Spanish
people are the most religious people of Europe, 95 per cent, of the
population approve this atrocious barbarism—not only approve it,
but demand that the King shall appear in the royal box at every
bull-fight, or have his throne upset.’</p>
<p>The notorious ‘Juke’ family of criminals, who sprang from a
single ruffian who lived in 1720, has cost the State of New York
millions of dollars in money and incalculable misery and crime. But
the initial savage progenitors of the human species have stocked
the earth with the most stupendous array of wrong-doers—knaves,
felons, kings, warriors, barbarians, butchers, brutalitarians,
kleptomaniacs, and thugs—that has ever (let us hope) brought
damnation to a world.</p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter8">VIII. Universal Ethics.</h3>
<p>There are the same reasons for the recognition by human beings
of ethical relations to non-human beings as there are for the
recognition by human beings of ethical relations among themselves
Analyse the reasons for being considerate toward men, any variety
of men, and you will find the same reasons to exist for being
considerate toward all men. And analyse the reasons for being
altruistic toward men—for being kind and sympathetic toward
them—and you will find the same reasons to exist for being
altruistic toward those who are not men. The doctrine that we human
beings may perform upon the other inhabitants of the earth all
sorts of injurious acts, and that these acts when so performed by
us are perfectly right and proper, but that these same things when
done by others to us are crimes, is the logic of pure
brutalitarianism. It is a doctrine utterly without intelligence, at
variance with every sentiment of justice and humanity, and has no
legitimate existence outside the fibrous brains of ruffians.</p>
<p><em>Right</em> and <em>wrong</em> are qualities belonging to two
diverse kinds of conduct. They are the qualities which render
conduct respectively proper and improper. All terrestrial races
(unless the very lowest) have the power of experiencing two kinds
of conscious states—the desirable (pleasurable) and the undesirable
(painful). Now, if beings were indifferent as to what sort of
conscious states entered into and made up their experiences, there
would manifestly be no such thing as propriety and impropriety in
the causing of these states. But they are not indifferent. The
pleasurable experiences are the experiences all beings are seeking,
and the painful ones are the ones they are all seeking to avoid.
Those acts which help or tend to help beings to those experiences
for which they are striving are, therefore, right and proper, and
are, they and their authors, called <em>good</em>. While those acts
which compel beings to undergo that which they are striving to
avoid are improper and wrong, and are, they and their authors,
called <em>bad</em>. Kindness, courtesy, justice, mercy,
generosity, sympathy, love, and the like, are good, and
selfishness, cruelty, deceit, pillage, injustice, and murder, are
bad, because they are respectively the promoters and destroyers of
wellbeing and happiness in the world.</p>
<p>But these two kinds of conduct produce the same respective
effects upon non-human beings as they do upon human beings. The
emotion of a mangled sensory—is it not the same terrible thing
whether the sensory hang to the brain of a quadruped or a man? Do
shelter and food not affect shivering and empty cattle, horses, and
fowls, precisely as they do human beings? Thunder harsh words at
your dog. Will he not shrink and suffer, just as your child or
hired hand will under like acts of terrorisation? Speak kindly to
him, love him, and accord to him a quarter of the consideration you
claim for yourself. Is he not caused to be one of the happiest and
most devoted of associates? To take squirrels or song-birds, the
most active of animals, and shut them up in narrow cages, and keep
them there shut off from their companions and their own green world
their whole lives long; to take an animal as sensitive and
high-minded as the horse and put a pack on his back and a bit in
his mouth, and then strike him dozens of times a day with a lash
whose touch is like fire; to shoot off the legs and wings of birds
and fill their vitals with lead, and leave them to flounder out a
lingering death in the reeds and grasses—do these things not cause
misery and desolation in the world? To place temptations in the way
of fur-bearing animals and induce them to enter carefully concealed
traps, and then allow them to remain in the villainous clutches of
these devices, not minutes, but hours, perhaps days, until it suits
the convenience of the ensnarer to knock out their brains, or
until, crazed by pain, the poor wretches eat off their own limbs
and escape—is not this a <em>monstrous</em> thing to do?</p>
<p>Oh that men everywhere were moved by the deep tenderness and the
all-embracing sympathy of poor Robert Burns, who could apologise
with real feeling to a frightened field-mouse whom he had
accidentally upturned with his plough.</p>

<p>Long ago it was said, and truthfully, that the merciful man is
merciful to his ox. The truly kind man, the truly honest and the
truly humane man, is not kind and honest and humane to men only,
but to <em>all</em> beings—to the humble and lowly as well as to
the proud and powerful—<em>to all that have the misfortune to feel
and mourn</em>. Benevolence is the same beautiful thing whether it
pour sunshine into the dark and saddened souls of men or into the
dark and saddened souls of other beings. John Howard never
hearkened to a nobler duty when he lifted the darkness that hung
over English gaols than will some inflamed soul some day who hears
the cry of the lonely captives who to-day languish in menagerial
dungeons to satisfy human curiosity. He who will emancipate horses
from the hell in which they pass their lives—make them the
associates of men instead of their slaves—will deserve to stand in
the constellation of the world’s redeemers beside Garrison and
Garibaldi. Is there he who holds in his heart-cups the love and
compassion of Buddha? Let him go where the dagger drips and the
heartless pole-axe crashes, and the meek-eyed millions of the
meadows pour out their innocent existences in the soulless houses
of slaughter. Let him lift from off the races the hounding incubus
of fear, give back to them their birthright—the right to a free,
unhunted life—and make the great monster (man) to be their
high-priest and friend.</p>

<p>‘Among the noblest in the land,<br />
Though he may count himself the least,<br />
That man I honour and revere<br />
Who, without favour, without fear,<br />
In the great city dares to stand<br />
The friend of every friendless beast,<br />
And tames with his unflinching hand<br />
The brutes that wear our form and face,<br />
The were-wolves of the human race.’</p>

<p>If to do good is to generate welfare, then to cause welfare to a
horse, a bird, a butterfly, or a fish, is to do good just as truly
as to cause welfare to men. And if to do evil is to cause
unhappiness and illfare, then to cause these things to one
individual or race is evil just as certainly as to cause them to
any other individual or race. And if to put one’s self in the place
of others, and to act toward them as one would wish them to act
toward him, is the one great rule—the Golden Rule—by which men are
to gauge their conduct when acting toward each other, then this is
also the one great rule—the Golden Rule—by which men are to
regulate their conduct toward all beings. There is no escape from
these conclusions, except for the savage and the
fool.<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter8-footnote1" id=

death to criminals, whether they be human or non-human beings,
individuals or species, is not, as is sometimes supposed, a
violation or reversal of the general theory of ethics. When they
are prompted by a spirit of tenderness and universal goodness
rather than by a spirit of revenge, penalties are justifiable by
the everyday assumption that it is sometimes wise to inflict or

<h3 id="part3-chapter9">IX. The Psychology of Altruism.</h3>
<p>The growth of altruism in the world has been largely
cotemporaneous with the growth of the power of <em>sympathy</em>.
Sympathy is the emotion a being has when by means of his
imagination he gets so actually into the place of another that his
own feelings duplicate more or less the feelings of that other. It
is the ability or the impulse to weep with those who weep, and
rejoice with those who are glad. Sympathy is the substance and the
only sure basis of morality—the only tie of sincere and lasting
mutualism. Men have always been to a considerable extent, and are
yet, disposed to think about and act toward each other from motives
of mutual fear or advantage. But such motives are not the highest
nor the most reliable bonds of fellowship and unity. True altruism
and solidarity—true expansion and universalisation of the self—are
found in sympathy. It is impossible for one individual to do in his
heart to another as he would that another should do to him, unless
he is at all times able and willing to get into the place of that
other, and to realise in his own consciousness the results to the
other of his acts. It is only when there is such an intertwining of
the consciousnesses that the joys and sorrows of each individual
consist to a greater or less extent of the reflexes of the joys and
sorrows around him that there exists true social oneness. The great
task of reforming the universe is, therefore, since the world is so
steeped in selfishness and hate, the task of endowing beings, or
the task of stocking the universe with beings, with dispositions to
get out of themselves. If the far-away first parents of men and
women had been broad-minded beings instead of narrow—had been
beings whose most natural impulse was to be kind to others, and
whose sympathies were as far-reaching as feeling—terrestrial life
would not to-day present to the all-seeing understanding the
disheartening spectacle it does present, and the long struggle for
justice and amelioration would not have been.</p>
<p>The primary fact prompting and underlying the exploitation of
one being or set of beings by another is, and has always been.
<em>Selfishness</em>. Whenever and wherever one people have
exploited another—whether the exploiters have been savages, Jews,
Romans, Caucasians, or men—they have done so primarily because the
act of exploitation was a convenience and pleasure to them and in
harmony with their natures. This selfishness, in the case of
civilised peoples, has been acquired by them through inheritance
from the savage tribes from whom they have severally evolved; and
the selfishness of the savage is a legacy from the animal forms
from whom the savage has come. Human selfishness is simply an eddy
of an impulse that is universal—an impulse that has been implanted
in the nature of the life-process of the earth by the manner in
which life has been evolved.</p>
<p>But there is another fact which has generally, if not always,
contributed to every act of exploitation in this world, and that is
<em>Ignorance</em>—ignorance on the part of those who have executed
the exploitation: not ignorance of grammar or geography or any
other particular branch of human information or philosophy, but
ignorance regarding those upon whom they have worked their
will—unconsciousness on the part of the exploiters of the
similarity which actually existed between themselves and their
victims. However free an individual may be from naturally selfish
impulses, he will never act in an altruistic manner toward others
unless he is able to realise that these others, are similar to
himself, and that acts toward them produce results of good and
evil, of welfare and suffering, similar to what these same acts
produce when done to himself. Altruistic conduct implies not only
altruistic impulses, but altruistic conceptions as well. Tyrants
hold, and have always held, themselves to be an entirely different
order of beings from their subjects, and far more deserving. Read
history—it is a tale told over and over. Between those who have
ruled and those who have served—between the Ends and the Means—has
ever yawned a chasm, wide, deep, and impassable. The exploited have
always been, according to their masters, a fibrous set, unfavoured
and unthought of by the gods, endowed with little feeling or
intelligence, and brought into existence more or less expressly as
adjuncts to their masters. This is the theory of the savage, and it
is the theory of all those who have inherited his narrow and
unfeeling philosophy. The Gentile had no rights because he was a
‘pagan.’ He was a human being, it is true, and had come forth from
the womb of woman, just as the Jew had. But he spoke a different
language from the Jews, had his own ways of life, belonged to a
different order of things, and was irritatingly unconcerned about
the gods and traditions of the ‘chosen people.’ The Gaul had no
rights that were inconvenient to Romans, because he was a
‘barbarian.’ The fact that he had blood, and brains, and nerves,
and love of life, and ambitions, and that he suffered when he was
subjected to humiliation, hard treatment, and death, just as Romans
did, was never really thought of by the arrogant and reckless
Romans. Romans never realised in their minds what it meant for
non-Romans to be treated as they were treated; and one reason why
they never realised it was because it was convenient for them not
to do so. To kill or enslave a Gaul or German we now know, who are
able to judge these acts from an un-Roman and unprejudiced point of
view, was practically the same crime as to kill or enslave a Roman.
But it was not so to Romans. The most trifling offence against a
Roman citizen was enough, according to Roman law, to condemn the
offender to execution. But the most horrible outrages, when
committed by Romans upon non-Romans, were nothing. Romans always
thought and felt <em>from the standpoint of Romans</em>. They never
got over into the world of the ‘barbarians,’ and really pictured to
themselves—<em>really felt</em>—the misfortunes of their victims.
It was the same way with the black man in the eyes of the white man
a generation or two ago; it is the same way with the brown man
to-day. The black man had no rights that were inconvenient for the
white man to respect, because he was a ‘nigger,’ and had no ‘soul,’
and was the offspring of Ham. This spirit of unconsciousness, which
has been so prominent throughout the history of mankind, still
survives in the minds of civilised men and women to-day, as is
shown by the conception (or <em>mis</em>conception) cherished by
the Caucasian toward the ‘nigger,’ by the Christian toward the
‘heathen,’ by the Moslem toward the ‘infidel,’ by the Protestant
toward the Catholic, and <em>vice versâ</em>, by the plutocrat
toward the proletarian, by men toward women, and by the human being
toward the ‘animal.’</p>
<p>The psychology of the exploitation of nonhuman beings by human
beings is not different in kind from the psychology of any other
act of exploitation. The great first cause of man’s inhumanity to
not-men is the same precisely as the great first cause of man’s
inhumanity to man—<em>Selfishness</em>—blind, brutal,
unconscionable egoism. Monopolist-like man thinks and cares only
about himself. He has the heart of the bully—deriving from the
contemplation of his fiendish supremacy a sort of monstrous
satisfaction. But there is also present in this case the same
half-sincere, half-fostered nescience as in all other cases of
exploitation. The ox, the hare, the bird, and the fish have no
rights in the world in which they live other than those that are
convenient for men to allow to them, because they are ‘animals.’
They are assumed to belong to an order of beings entirely different
from that to which human beings belong. They are filled with
nerves, and brains, and bloodvessels; they love life, and bleed,
and struggle, and cry out when their veins are opened, just as
human beings do; they have the same general form and structure of
body, their bodies are composed of the same organs busied with the
same functions; and they are descended from the same ancestors and
have been developed in the same world through the operation of the
same great laws as we ourselves have. But all of these things, and
dozens of others just as significant, are disregarded by us in our
hard-hearted determination to exploit them. We have a set of words
and phrases which we use in speaking of ourselves, and another very
different set for other beings. The very same things are called by
different names with wholly different connotations depending on
whether it is a man that is referred to or some other being. It is
‘murder’ to take the life of a human being, but to take the life of
a sheep or a cow is only ‘knocking it on the head.’ A man may
murder squirrels or birds all day—that is, he may do that which
when done to human beings is called murder—but it is only ‘sport’
when done to these humble inhabitants of the wilds. The dead body
of a man is a ‘corpse’; the dead body of a quadruped is only a
‘carcass.’ A race of horses or dogs is a ‘breed’; but a breed of
men and women is always respectfully referred to as a race. We
perpetuate our blindness by the use of words. We accommodate our
consciences by inventing ways of looking at things that will bring
out our own lustre and relieve us from the ghastly faces of our
crimes. For the human race to rob and kill other races is the same
kind of activity exactly as it is for human beings to rob and kill
each other. But it is not considered so to-day—except by a few
lost-caste ‘visionaries’ scattered here and there over Christendom,
and some millions of ‘heathens’ in Asia.</p>
<p>A short time ago a series of letters came into my hands written
from Burmah by an American missionary in that country. According to
this writer, one of the greatest obstacles the missionaries have to
contend with in their work there is the hostility aroused in the
people by the killing and flesh-eating habits of the missionaries
themselves. The native inhabitants, who are the most compassionate
of mankind, look upon the Christian missionaries, who kill and eat
cows and shoot monkeys for pastime, as being little better than
cannibals. Contemplate the presumption necessary to cause an
individual to leave behind him fields white for mission-work, and
travel, at great expense, halfway round the earth in order to
preach a narrow, cruel, anthropocentric gospel to a people of so
great tenderness and humanity as to be kind even to ‘animals’ and
enemies!</p>
<p>We human beings feel at liberty to commit any kind of outrage
upon other races, and these outrages are looked upon by us as
nothing. But the most trifling annoyances of other races are deemed
by us of sufficient consequence to justify us in visiting upon them
the most fearful retributions. We can break up the laboriously
built home of a mother mouse in the rubbish-heap of our back yard,
scatter the pink babies of that mother over the ground to die of
cold and starvation, and cause the frightened mother to flee at the
risk of her very life—all to give to the terrier and ourselves a
little moment of savage pastime. But if that same mother, some hard
winter’s night, when she has failed in her search elsewhere for
something to stay her hunger, comes into our larder and nibbles a
bit of cheese or a few mouthfuls of crust from our pie, although
she takes but a crumb in all, and is as dainty in her feeding as a
lady, we immediately get out our traps and poisons and storm around
as if a murder or some other irreparable wrong had been committed.
We think of our acts toward non-human peoples, when we think of
them at all, <em>entirely from the human point of view</em>. We
never take the time to put ourselves in the places of our victims.
We never take the trouble to get over into their world, and realise
what is happening over there as a result of our doings toward them.
It is so much more comfortable not to do so—<em>so much more
comfortable to be blind and deaf and insane</em>. We go on quieting
our consciences, as best we can, by the fact that everybody else
nearly is engaged in the same business as we are, and by the fact
that so few ever say anything about the matter—anaesthetised, as it
were, by the universality of our iniquities and the infrequency of
disquieting reminders.</p>
<p>Many years ago an eccentric but gifted Englishman had a dream in
which he saw the fortunes of the world reversed. Man was no longer
master, but victim. The earth was ruled by the birds and
quadrupeds, the mice and monkeys, who proceeded to inflict upon
their erstwhile tyrant the same cruelties he had hitherto inflicted
upon them. ‘Multitudes of human beings were systematically fattened
for the carnivora. They were frequently forwarded to great
distances by train, in trucks, without food or water. Large numbers
of infants were constantly boiled down to form broth for invalid
animals. In over-populous districts babies were given to malicious
young cats and dogs to be taken away and drowned. Boys were hunted
by terriers and stoned to death by frogs. Mice were a good deal
occupied in setting mantraps, baited with toasted cheese, in poor
neighbourhoods. Gouty old gentlemen were hitched to night-cabs, and
forced to totter, on their weak ankles and diseased joints, to
clubs, where fashionable young colts were picked up, and taken, at
such speed as whipcord could extract, to visit chestnut fillies.
Flying figures in scarlet coats, buckskins, and top-boots were run
down by packs of foxes that had nothing else to do. Old cock-grouse
strutted out for a morning’s sport, and came in to talk of how many
brace of country gentlemen they had bagged. Gamekeepers lived a
precarious life in holes and caves. They were perpetually harried
by game and vermin; held fast in steel traps, their toes were
nibbled by stoats and martens; and finally, their eyes picked out
by owls and kites, they were gibbeted alive on trees, head
downwards, until the termination of their martyrdom. In one
especially tragic case, a naturalist in spectacles dodged about
painfully among the topmost branches of a wood, while a mias
underneath, armed with a gun, inflicted on him dreadful wounds. A
veterinary surgeon of Alfort was stretched on his back, his arms
and legs secured to posts, in order that a horse might cut him up
alive for the benefit of an equine audience; but the generous
steed, incapable of vindictive feelings, with one disdainful stamp
on the midriff, crushed the wretch’s life out’.<sup><small><a href=

<p>The following is from the Chinese. The speaker is an ox:</p>
<p>‘I request, good people, that you will listen to what I have to
say. <em>In the whole world there is no distress equal to that of
the ox</em>. In spring and summer, autumn and winter, I diligently
put forth my strength; during the four seasons there is no respite
to my labours. I drag the plough, a thousand-pound weight fastened
to my shoulders. Hundreds of thousands of lashes are, by a leather
whip, inflicted upon me. Curses and abuses, in a thousand forms are
poured upon me. I am driven, with threatenings, rapidly along, and
not allowed to stand still. Through the dry ground or the deep
water I with difficulty drag the plough, with an empty belly; the
tears flow from both my eyes. I hope in the morning that I shall be
early released, but I am detained until the evening. If, with a
hungry stomach, I eat the grass in the middle of the field, the
whole family, great and small, insultingly abuse me. I am left to
eat any species of herbs among the hills, but you, my master,
yourself receive the grain that is sown in the field. Of the
<em>chen paddy</em> you make rice; of the <em>no paddy</em> you
make wine. You have cotton, wheat, and herbs of a thousand
different kinds. Your garden is full of vegetables. When your men
and women marry, amid all your felicity, if there be a want of
money, you let me out to others. When pressed for the payment of
duties, you devise no plans, but take and sell the ox that ploughs
your field. When you see that I am old and weak, you sell me to the
butcher to be killed. The butcher conducts me to his home and soon
strikes me in the forehead with the head of an iron hatchet, after
which I am left to die in the utmost distress. My skin is peeled
off, my bones are scraped, and my skin is taken to cover the drum
by which the country is alarmed.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Witness the patient ox, with stripes and yells<br />
Driven to the slaughter, goaded as he runs<br />
To madness, while the savage at his heels<br />
Laughs at the frantic sufferer’s fury.’<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The angler brags about his ‘haul’ and the hunter about his ‘bag’
and his ‘big game’ with as little realisation of what these things
mean as the slave-master boasts of his ‘niggers.’ Men talk of
‘chops’ and ‘steaks’ and ‘roasts’ with the same somnambulism, the
same profound unconsciousness of what these things really signify
in the psychic economies of the world, as the conqueror
contemplates his ‘captives,’ the robber his ‘spoil,’ or the savage
his ‘scalps.’ If before the eyes and in the mind of each individual
who sits unconcernedly down to a parsleyed ‘steak’ could rise the
facts in the biography of that ‘steak’—the happy heifer on the far
western meadows, the fateful day when she is forced by the drover’s
whip from her home,<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter9-footnote2"
id="part3-chapter9-ref2" name=
"part3-chapter9-ref2">[2]</a></small></sup> the arduous ‘drive’ to
the village and her baffled efforts to escape, the crowding into
cars and the long, painful journey, the silent heartaches and the
low, pitiful moans, the terrible hunger and thirst and cold, her
arrival, bruised and bewildered, in the city, her dazed mingling
with others, the great murder-house, the prods and bellowings, the
treacherous crash of the brain-axe, the death drop and shudder, the
butcher’s knife, the gush of blood from her pretty throat, and the
glassy gaze of her dead but beautiful eyes—there would be, in spite
of the inherent hardness of the human heart, a great drawing back
from those acts which render such fearful things necessary. If
human beings <em>could only realise</em> what the hare suffers, or
the stag, when it is pursued by dogs, horses, and men bent on
taking its life, or what the fish feels when it is thrust through
and flung into suffocating gases, no one of them, not even the most
recreant, could find pleasure in such work. <em>How painful</em> to
a person of tenderness and enlightenment is <em>even the
thought</em> of rabbit-shootings, duck-slaughterings, bear-hunts,
quail-killing expeditions, tame pigeon massacres, and the like! And
yet with what light-hearted enthusiasm the mindless ruffians who do
these atrocious things enter upon them! One would think that grown
men would be ashamed to arm themselves and go out with horses and
hounds and engage in such babyish and unequal contests as sportsmen
usually rely on for their peculiar ‘glory.’ And they would be if
grown men were not so often simply able-bodied bullies. <em>If
human beings could only realise what it means to live in a world
and associate day after day with other beings more intelligent and
powerful than themselves, and yet be regarded by these more
intelligent individuals simply as merchandise to be bought and
sold, or as targets to be shot at, they would hide their guilty
heads in shame and horror</em>.</p>
<p>The Being from whose breaking heart gushed these lines of sorrow
and sympathy on seeing a wounded hare was a god:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Inhuman man! curse on thy barbarous art,<br />
And blasted be thy murder-aiming eye:<br />
May never pity soothe thee with a sigh,<br />
Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart!<br />
<br />
‘Go, live, poor wanderer of the wood and field<br />
The bitter little that of life remains;<br />
No more the thickening brakes and verdant plains<br />
To thee shall home, or food, or pastime yield.<br />
<br />
‘Seek, mangled one, some place of wonted rest,<br />
No more of rest, but now thy dying bed;<br />
The sheltering rushes whistling o’er thy head.<br />
The cold earth with thy bloody bosom pressed.<br />
<br />
‘Oft, as by winding Nith I, musing, wait<br />
The sober eve or hail the cheerful dawn,<br />
I’ll miss thee sporting o’er the dewy lawn.<br />
And curse the ruffian’s aim and mourn thy hapless fate.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We human beings, in our conduct toward the races of beings
associated with us on this planet, are almost pure
<em>savages</em>. We are not even half civilised. And this fact is
certain to bring upon us the criticism and condemnation of the more
enlightened generations to come. The fact is apparent to-day,
however—just as apparent as the barbarity of the Romans—to everyone
who will take the trouble to rid himself of the prejudices which
enslave and blind him, and view human phenomena from an un-human,
extra-terrestrial point of view.</p>
<p>To most persons—to all except to a few—everything is simply a
matter of habit and education. And a majority of persons, too, can
become educated to one thing about as easily and completely as they
can to another. In Mr. Huxley’s ‘Man’s Place in Nature’ there is
reprinted from an old volume the picture of a butcher’s shop as it
is said to have existed among the savage Anziques of Africa in the
sixteenth century. Mr. Huxley says that the original engraving
claims to represent an actual fact, and that he has himself no
doubt but it does really stand for just what it purports to
represent, especially since the fact has been corroborated by Du
Chaillu in comparatively recent times. The fact for which this old
picture stands is a good illustration of the power of custom in
shaping human ideas. In this savage ‘market’ pretty much the same
line of goods appears as is found in modern ‘markets,’ except that,
instead of the quartered corpses of sheep and bullocks, there hang
the shoulders, thighs, and gory heads of men. The butcher is
represented as standing beside the chopping-block in the act of
cutting up the leg of a man. A child’s head and other fragments of
the human body are piled up on another block, and behind these on
pegs are ranged the more pretentious wares of the establishment.
‘Presently we passed a woman,’ says Du Chaillu, in speaking of the
cannibalism of the Fans, who were probably identical with those
referred to two centuries earlier as Anziques. ‘She bore with her a
piece of the thigh of a human body, just as we should go to market
and carry thence a roast of steak.’ We can easily imagine (by the
help of the sights we see every day) the anthropophagous crowd
standing around giving their early morning orders, and the
enterprising assassin hustling about to wait on them. One of them
wants an arm, another wants a leg, another a liver, another a
half-dozen nice fat ribs. One fellow wants a tender ‘cut’ of young
girl’s sirloin, and another would like an old man’s calf for soup.
A little naked urchin, who has had to wait a long time in order to
get a chance to buy anything at all, exchanges a few shells for a
section of human bologna. One fellow wants to know the price of the
boy’s head which lies on the neighbouring block, and a woman
complains that the baby’s brains which she bought the day before,
and which were recommended as being especially ‘fresh and nice,’
turned out to be ‘bad.’ We can see them go home with their gruesome
purchases, cook them, and sit down and eat them, discussing their
flavour or their lack of it, and remarking their tenderness,
toughness, or juiciness, and finally throwing the bones out to the
dogs—all with as little thought of the immorality of it as
‘Thanksgiving’ gluttons have to-day at their feasts of blood. There
may have been an occasional ‘visionary’ among these people
fanatical enough to ‘refuse to eat meat,’ or even to protest
against the practice. Probably there was. There generally are a few
such discordants in every generation of vipers. But ‘fanatics’ in
those days were in all likelihood, as they are to-day, too few to
be troublesome.</p>
<p>To anyone familiar with the pliability of the human conscience,
or with the soundness and depth of intellectual sleep, these things
are neither impossible nor strange. There is so little looking into
the essence of things, so little looking at things as they are, and
so much thinking and doing as we are accustomed or told to think
and do—there are, in fact, so few who can really think at all—that
if we had been accustomed and taught to do so from childhood, and
the world were practically unanimous in its conduct and teachings
on the matter, very few of us indeed would not sit down to a
breakfast of scrambled infant’s brains, a luncheon of cold boiled
aunt, or a dinner of roast uncle, with as little compunction,
perhaps with the same horrible merriment, as we to-day attend a
‘barbecue’ or a ‘turkey.’ Why should we not make hash and sausages
out of our broken-down grandfathers and grandmothers just as we do
out of our worn-out horses, and help out the pigeons at our killing
carnivals with a few live peasants? How much more artistic and
civilised to pile our tables on holy days with the gold and crimson
of the fields and orchards than to load them with the dead! And yet
how strangely few are mature enough to care anything at all about
the matter.</p>
<p>Oh, the helplessness and irresponsibility of the human mind!
There is no spontaneity, no originality, only the dead level of the
machine. How impossible it is for us to think, to discover anything
unassisted, to perceive anything after it has been pointed out to
us even, if it is a little different from what we are used to!
This, it seems to me, is one of the most pathetic things in all
this world—this illimitable impotence, this powerlessness to
inspect things from any other point of view than the one we inherit
when we come into the world; to be a knave or lunatic (or the next
thing to it), and never have the slightest suspicion of the fact.
The human mind will certainly not always be this way. It will
surely be different some time. It seems incredible that the planet
will drag along in disgrace this way forever. The men of Europe and
America are not so primitive as the junglemen, and the junglemen
are superior in some respects to the quadrupeds and reptiles, and
this gives reason for a little hope. <em>But when that is the
question, when will it be? In what distant time will the Golden
Dream of our prophetic hours come to this poor darkened larva of a
world?</em> Ages upon ages after our little existences have gone
out, and the detritus of our wasted bodies has wandered long in the
labyrinths of the sod or been sown by aimless gusts over our native
hills.</p>

<h3 id="part3-chapter10">X. Anthropocentric Ethics.</h3>
<p>Anthropocentricism, which drifted down as a tradition from
ancient times, and which for centuries shaped the theories of the
Western world, but whose respectability among thinking people has
now nearly passed away, was, perhaps, the boldest and most
revolting expression of human provincialism and conceit ever
formulated by any people. It was the doctrine that man was the
centre about whom revolved all facts and interests whatsoever; and
Judaism and its two children, Christianity and Mahometanism, were
responsible for it. Everything, according to this conception, was
interpreted in terms of human utility. Everything was made for
man—including women. The sun and moon were luminaries, not worlds,
hung there by the fatherly manufacturer of things for the
convenience and delight of his children. The stars were
perforations in the overarching concave through which eavesdropping
prophets peered into celestial secrets, and errand-angels came and
went with messages between gods and men. Not only the spheres in
space, but the earth and all it contained—the rivers, seas, and
seasons, all the plants that grow, and all the flowers that blow,
and all the millions that swim and suffer in the waters and
skies—were, according to this remorseless notion, the soulless
adjuncts of man. Intrinsically they were meaningless. They had
significance only as they served the human species. The hues and
perfumes of flowers, the songs of birds, the dews, the breezes, the
rains, the rocks, the ‘beasts of the field and the fowls of the
air,’ the great forests, the mighty mountains, the fearful
solitudes, even famine and pestilence, were all made for the being
with the reinless imagination. Luther believed that the fly—festive
little <em>Musca domestica</em>, who inhabits our homes, and
sometimes unwittingly wanders over our tender places—was a
pestiferous invention of the devil, maliciously sent to annoy him
in his meditations. Garlic grew on the swamp brim as a handy
antidote for human malaria. Fruits ripened in the summertime
because the acids and juices which they contained were believed to
be necessary for man’s health and refreshment. The great muscles of
the ox were made to provide men with delicacies and leisure. The
cloak of the ewe was made without any special thought, or without
any thought at all, of the comforts of the ewe. It was placed there
on the ewe by an all-tender creator, to be torn by his images from
her bleeding back and worn. The fossil forms found in the rocks
were not the <em>bonâ fide</em> remains of creatures that had lived
and perished when the calcareous foundations of the continents were
forming in ancient sea-beds. They were counterfeits, slyly designed
by a suspicious providence, and sandwiched among the strata ‘to
test human faith.’ The rainbow was a phenomenon with which the laws
of reflection and refraction had nothing whatever to do. It was a
sign or seal stamped on the retreating storms as a pledge that
submersion would not be again used as a punishment for sinners. The
universal ruler was conceived to be an individual of transcendent
power and respectability, but was supposed to spend the most of his
time and a good deal of anxiety on the regulation and repair of his
illustrious likenesses.</p>
<p>The history of intellectual evolution is the history of
disillusionment. The stars, we now know, are not hatchways, but
worlds. They burn because they are fire. They blaze and circle in
obedience to their own unchangeable inertias, just as the earth
does. They blazed and wheeled when the elemental matters of the
earth mingled indistinguishably with the vapours of the sun, and
they will blaze and wheel when the last inhabitant of this clod has
dissolved into the everlasting atoms. The earth is not the capital
of cosmos nor the subject of celestial anxiety. The earth is a
satrap of the sun—a subordinate among servants, not a sovereign
with a retinue of stars. The earth and its contents were not made
for man. They were not made at all. They were evolved. The concaves
of the sea have been hollowed, the mountains upheaved, and the
continents planted and peopled, by the same tendencies as those
that hold the universes in their grasp. The primal matters of the
earth came out of the substance of the sun, and by the play and
activity of these elements and the play and activity of their
derivatives were evolved all the multitudinous forms of land,
fluid, plant, animal, and society. The flowers that ‘blush unseen’
do not necessarily ‘waste their sweetness on the desert air,’ as
the poet so melodiously imagines. The colours and scents of flowers
serve their purposes—which are to secure the services of insects in
fertilisation—quite as well when unperceived, as when perceived by
human senses. The non-human races of beings were not made for human
beings. They were evolved—the higher forms from the lower forms,
and the lower forms from still lower—just as the higher societies
of men have been evolved, under the eye of history, out of
barbarism and savagery. They are our ancestors. They have made
human life and civilisation possible. They made their homes on
primeval land patches when the continents we creep over were
sleeping in the seas. They lived and loved and suffered and died in
order that a being intelligent enough to analyse himself and
recreant enough to pick their bones might come into the world.</p>
<p>There are supposed to be something like a million (maybe there
are several million) species of inhabitants living on the earth.
The human species is one of these. Not more than a few thousand of
these species are seriously advantageous to men. The harmful and
useless species are many times more numerous than the helpful. Now,
if the 999,999 non-human species were made for the human species,
why were the hundreds of thousands of species made that are of no
possible human importance, and the hundreds of thousands of other
species that are a positive injury? And if by some miraculous
stretch of imagination the 999,999 species now living on the earth
are conceived to have been made for man, why were the 10,000,000 or
15,000,000 of species made that lived and passed away before there
was a human being in existence. Perhaps the traditionist will
say—accustomed as he is to treat syllogisms with contempt—that they
were made to invigorate human ‘faith.’</p>
<p>If the age of the human species be estimated at 50,000 years and
the age of the life-process at 100,000,000 years, the time during
which man has been on the earth is, when compared with the entire
period during which the planet has been tenanted, as 1 to 2,000.
And the time during which the earth has been inhabited—immense as
that time is when compared with the little span of human history—is
also insignificant when compared with the enormous lapse of time
during which the planet was slowly cooling and solidifying
preliminary to the existence of life. And the entire life of the
planet—inconceivably vast as it is—is as nothing compared with that
eternity, that duration without beginning or close, during which
the sidereal millions have undergone, and are destined to continue
to undergo, their countless and immeasurable transformations.</p>
<p>It is about as profound to suppose that the earth and its
contents, and the suns, stars, and systems of space, were all made
for a single species inhabiting an obscure ball located in a remote
quarter of the universe as it is to suppose that the gigantic body
of the elephant was made for the wisp of hair on the tip of its
tail. <em>Man</em> is <em>not</em> the <em>end</em>, he is but an
<em>incident</em>, of the infinite elaborations of Time and
Space.</p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter11">XI. Ethical Implications of
Evolution.</h3>
<p>The doctrine of organic evolution, which forever established the
common genesis of all animals, sealed the doom of
anthropocentricism. Whatever the inhabitants of this world were or
were thought to be before the publication of ‘The Origin of
Species,’ they never could be anything since then but a
<em>family</em>. The doctrine of evolution is probably the most
important revelation that has come to the world since the
illuminations of Galileo and Copernicus. The authors of the
Copernican theory enlarged and corrected human understanding by
disclosing to man the comparative littleness of his world—by
discovering that the earth, which had up to that time been supposed
to be the centre and capital of cosmos, is in reality a satellite
of the sun. This heliocentric discovery was hard on human conceit,
for it was the first broad hint man had thus far received of his
true dimensions. The doctrine of evolution has had, and is having,
and is destined to continue to have, a similarly correcting effect
on the naturally narrow conceptions of men. It tends to fry the
conceit out of us. It has been impossible since Darwin for any sane
and honest man to go around bragging about having been ‘made in the
image of his maker,’ or to successfully lay claim to a more
honourable origin than the rest of the creatures of the earth. And
if men had accepted the logical consequences of Darwin’s teachings,
the world would not to-day—a half-century after his revelation—be
filled with practices which find their only support and
justification in out-of-date traditions. But logical consequences,
as Huxley observes, are the official scarecrows of that large and
prolific class of defectives usually known as fools. The doctrine
of evolution is accepted in one form or another by practically all
who think. It is taught even in school primers. But while the
<em>biology</em> of evolution is scarcely any longer questioned,
the <em>psychology</em> and <em>ethics</em> of the Darwinian
revelation, though following from the same premises, and almost as
inevitably, are yet to be generally realised. Darwin’s revelation,
like every other revelation that has come to the world, is
perceived most tardily by those working in departments where the
phenomena are the most intangible and complicated.</p>
<p>Darwin himself called ‘the love for all living creatures the
most noble attribute of man.’ Giant as he was, he perceived more
clearly than any of his contemporaries, more clearly even than his
successors, the ultimate goal of evolving altruism. For he says:
‘As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united into
larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual
that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all
members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. There
is, then, only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies
extending to the men of all nations and races. Experience, however,
shows us how long it is, if such men are separated from him by
great differences of appearance or habits, before he looks upon
them as his fellow-creatures. Sympathy beyond the confines of man
is one of the latest moral acquisitions. It is apparently unfelt by
savages, except for their pets. The very idea of humanity, so far
as I could observe, was new to most of the Gauchos of the Pampas.
This virtue seems to arise from our sympathies becoming more tender
and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient
beings.’<sup><small><a href="#part3-chapter11-footnote1" id=
"part3-chapter11-ref1" name=
"part3-chapter11-ref1">[1]</a></small></sup></p>
<p>The influences of a doctrine old enough and precious enough to
have become embodied in the life and institutions of a race persist
generally, through mere momentum, long after the substance of the
doctrine has passed away. This is eminently true of that
misconception which has come down to us regarding the nature and
origin of man and his relations to the rest of the universe. Darwin
has lived, shed his light over the world, and passed back to the
dust whence he came. Men no longer believe that other races and
other worlds were really made for them. But they continue to
<em>act</em> in about the same manner as they did when; they
<em>did</em> believe it. This assertion applies not simply to those
half-baked intelligences who have only the rudest and most
antiquated notions about anything but also to thousands of men and
women who pretend to have up-to-date conceptions of themselves and
the universe—men and women noted even for their activity in
reminding others of their inconsistency—men and women who</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Compound for sins they are inclined to,<br />
By damning those they have no mind to.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The doctrine of Universal Kinship is not a new doctrine, born
from the more brilliant loins of modern understanding. It is as old
almost as human philosophy. It was taught by Buddha twenty-four
hundred years ago. And the teachings of this divine soul, spreading
over the plains and peninsulas of Asia, have made unnumbered
millions mild. It was taught also by Pythagoras and all his school
of philosophers, and rigidly practised in their daily lives.
Plutarch, one of the grandest characters of antiquity, wrote
several essays in advocacy of it. In these essays, as well as in
many passages of his writings generally, he demonstrates that he
was far ahead of his contemporaries in the breadth and intensity of
his moral nature, and in advance even of all except a very few of
those living to-day, 2,000 years after him. Shelley among the poets
of modern times, and Tolstoy in these latter days, are others among
the eminent adherents of this holy cause.</p>
<p>Wherever Buddhism prevails, there will be found in greater or
less purity, as one of the cardinal principles of its founder, the
doctrine of the sacredness of all Sentient Life. But the Aryan race
of the West has remained steadfastly deaf to the pleadings of its
Shelleys and Tolstoys, owing to the overmastering influence of its
anthropocentric religions. Not till the coming of Darwin and his
school of thinkers was there a basis for hope of a reformed world.
To-day the planet is <em>ripe</em> for the old-new doctrine.
Tradition is losing its power over men’s conduct and conceptions as
never before, and Science is growing more and more influential. A
central truth of the Darwinian philosophy is the unity and
consanguinity of all organic life. And during the next century or
two the ethical corollary of this truth is going to receive
unprecedented recognition in all departments of human thought.
Ignorance and Inertia are fearful facts. They endure like granite
in the human mind. But the tireless chisels of evolution are
invincible. And the time will come when the anthropocentric customs
and conceptions, which are to-day fashionable enough to be
‘divine,’ will have nothing but a historic existence. The movement
to put Science and Humanitarianism in place of Tradition and
Savagery, which is so weak, languishing, and neglected to-day, is a
movement which has for its ultimate destiny the conquest of the
Human Species.</p>

edit.; London, 1874.</small></p>
<h3 id="part3-chapter12">XII. Conclusion.</h3>
<p><em>All beings are ends;</em> <em>no</em> creatures are
<em>means</em>. All beings have not equal rights, neither have all
men; but <em>all have rights</em>. The <em>Life Process</em> is the
<em>End</em>—<em>not man</em>, nor any other animal temporarily
privileged to weave a world’s philosophy. Nonhuman beings were not
made for human beings any more than human beings were made for
nonhuman beings. Just as the sidereal spheres were once supposed by
the childish mind of man to be unsubstantial satellites of the
earth, but are known by man’s riper understanding to be worlds with
missions and materialities of their own, and of such magnitude and
number as to render terrestrial insignificance frightful, so the
billions that dwell in the seas, fields, and atmospheres of the
earth were in like manner imagined by the illiterate children of
the race to be the mere trinkets of men, but are now known by all
who can interpret the new revelation to be beings with
substantially the same origin, the same natures, structures, and
occupations, and the same general rights to life and happiness, as
we ourselves.</p>
<p>In their phenomena of life the inhabitants of the earth display
endless variety. They swim in the waters, soar in the skies,
squeeze among the rocks, clamber among the trees, scamper over the
plains, and glide among the grounds and grasses. Some are born for
a summer, some for a century, and some flutter their little lives
out in a day. They are black, white, blue, golden, all the colours
of the spectrum. Some are wise and some are simple; some are large
and some are microscopic; some live in castles and some in
bluebells; some roam over continents and seas, and some doze their
little day-dream away on a single dancing leaf. But they are all
the children of a common mother and the co-tenants of a common
world. Why they are here in this world rather than some place else;
why the world in which they find themselves is so full of the
undesirable; and whether it would not have been better if the ball
on which they ride and riot had been in the beginning sterilised,
are problems too deep and baffling for the most of them. But since
they are here, and since they are too proud or too superstitious to
die, and are surrounded by such cold and wolfish immensities, what
would seem more proper than for them to be kind to each other, and
helpful, and dwell together as loving and forbearing members of One
Great Family?</p>
<p class="small-caps">Act toward others as you would act toward a
part of your own self.</p>
<p>This is <em>The Great Law</em>, the all-inclusive gospel of
social salvation. It is the rule of social rectitude and perfection
which has been held up in greater or less perfection in all ages by
the sages and prophets of the human species.</p>
<p>Hear Confucius, the giant of Mongolia, and the idol and
law-giver of one-third of mankind:</p>
<p>‘What you do not like when done to yourself do not do to
others.’</p>
<p>And again he says:</p>
<p>‘Do not let a man practise to those beneath him that which he
dislikes in those above him.’</p>
<p>Over and over again the illustrious master repeats these
precepts to his disciples and countrymen.</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata, the great epic of the Sanskrit, written by
Indian moralists in various ages, and representing the accumulated
wisdom of one of the most marvellous of all peoples, we find these
words:</p>
<p>‘Treat others as thou wouldst thyself be treated.’</p>
<p>‘Do nothing to thy neighbour which thou wouldst not hereafter
have thy neighbour do to thee.’</p>
<p>‘A man obtains a rule of action by looking upon his neighbour as
himself.’</p>
<p>These same truths were also taught by Jesus, that godlike
Galilean, the great teacher and saviour of the Western world:</p>
<p>‘Love thy neighbour as thyself.’</p>
<p>‘Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.’</p>
<p>Oh that these words were etched in fire, and stamped in
scorching characters on the dull, cold hearts of this world!</p>
<p class="small-caps">Act toward others as you would act toward a
part of your own self.</p>
<p>Look upon and treat others as you do your own hands, your own
eyes, your very heart and soul—with infinite care and compassion—as
suffering and enjoying members of the same Great Being with
yourself. This is the spirit of the ideal universe—the spirit of
your own being. It is this alone that can redeem this world, and
give to it the peace and harmony for which it longs. Yes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘So many gods, so many creeds,<br />
So many paths that wind and wind,<br />
While just the art of being kind<br />
Is all the sad world needs.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh the madness, and sorrow, and unbrotherliness of this
mal-wrought world! Oh the poor, weak, poisoned, monstrous natures
of its children! Who can look upon it all without pain, and
sympathy, and consternation, and tears? What an opportunity for
philanthropy, if the ‘All-mighty One’ of our traditions would only
set about it!</p>
<p>Yes, do as you would be done by—and <em>not</em> to the dark man
and the white woman alone, but to the sorrel horse and the gray
squirrel as well; <em>not</em> to creatures of your own anatomy
only, but to all creatures. You cannot go high enough nor low
enough nor far enough to find those whose bowed and broken beings
will not rise up at the coming of the kindly heart, or whose souls
will not shrink and darken at the touch of inhumanity. Live and let
live. Do more. Live and <em>help</em> live. <em>Do to beings below
you as you would be done by beings above you</em>. Pity the
tortoise, the katydid, the wild-bird, and the ox. Poor,
undeveloped, untaught creatures! Into their dim and lowly lives
strays of sunshine little enough, though the fell hand of man be
never against them. They are our fellow-mortals. They came out of
the same mysterious womb of the past, are passing through the same
dream, and are destined to the same melancholy end, as we
ourselves. Let us be kind and merciful to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?<br />
Draw near them, then, in being merciful;<br />
Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us be true to our ideals, true to the spirit of Universal
Compassion—whether we walk with the lone worm wandering in the
twilight of consciousness, the feathered forms of the fields and
forests, the kine of the meadows, the simple savage on the banks of
the gladed river, the political blanks whom men call wives, or the
outcasts of human industry.</p>
<p>Oh this poor world, this poor, suffering, ignorant, fear-filled
world! How can men be blind or deranged enough to think it is a
good world? How can they be cold and satanic enough to be unmoved
by the groans and anguish, the writhing and tears, that come up
from its unparalleled afflictions?</p>
<p>But <em>the world is growing better</em>. And in the Future—in
the long, long ages to come—<span class="small-caps">it will be
redeemed</span>! The same spirit of sympathy and fraternity that
broke the black man’s manacles and is to-day melting the white
woman’s chains will to-morrow emancipate the working man and the
ox; and, as the ages bloom and the great wheels of the centuries
grind on, the same spirit shall banish Selfishness from the earth,
and convert the planet finally into one unbroken and unparalleled
spectacle of <span class="small-caps">Peace</span>, <span class=
"small-caps">Justice</span>, and <span class=
"small-caps">Solidarity</span>.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
